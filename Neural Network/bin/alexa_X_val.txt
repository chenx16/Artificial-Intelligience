love it we are still learning the capabilities having a lot of fun
very easy setup
 
i purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because i found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking cutting cleaning etc especially when our counters aren’t very wide to begin with after going back and forth between this and the show i decided on this because i felt it had all the same features but is more compact i can honestly say i have no regrets while i probably wouldn’t watch a movie i would been dying to see on this it is a great way to listen to music watch a quick youtube video etc i even attempted watching jaws on this and while it wasn’t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do it wasn’t as bad as one would think i would definitely recommend
fun and  information  no dislikes  so far  like the convenience
i am very pleased with the fire stick
love these  great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering  or listen to cnn live with serius sm
speakers are not as loud as google home
echo dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time
easy to use great for recipes listen to music see movies movie trailers so much to do
las películas no tiene o no se pueden cambiar a español o títulos en español
thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality not much better than the echo dot not worth the money
worked as advertised thanks
easy set up and to use i bought two one for my house and one for my 75 year old grandfather i set it up for him a gave him a 15 minute lesson and he calls me at least once a day it is is great to be able to see him in between visits
still love it
i did not like that almost everytime i asked alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that
so far i like it  i bought it just for some music though and it sounds pretty good
great definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 i can not really regret it at all love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to the smiths
really like it
finally bought one but it could not find my wi fi had to buy a wi fi extended my smart tv used the wi fi just fine
love my echo show now i can listen to music get recipes and so much more i highly recommend the echo for everyone
i don'r know how to use it yet  need more explicit directions for the electeonically challenged  i did not get the feee lifht bulb that was part of the package
love it it is in my kitchen so i can watch prime video while cooking
netflix and hulu
excellent bought another one yesterday
we enjoy it
the best
i love it
wonderful product and fast delivery
not bad bad speaker for sound
we have only been using alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy it like having a new household member we are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it
good value
we now have a dot spot echo and show and love the show and spot best the show has great sound and my wife loves the display for weather recipes and sing alongside super deal
awesome wish i had gotten one sooner
small device that my kids like to ask questions very handy friendly interactive
excellent to listen to my music my audio books and look all my cameras in and around my house
very good quality
i like the echo spot because it fits into my decor and i can also sing along with my favorite songs
it works great
i love this fire stick because after installing a few highly recommended apps i discovered that a lot of the channels i do not have with my cable provider is included  and i do not have to pay extra just subscribing to a few streaming apps will do and i still come out paying way less than cable tv
used for personal use we like hearing weather news from cnn and various playlists
the product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has  and even that one has bluetooth and does not need to be plugged in the only good thing about this is that you can speak to it
i like the option for white but it is bizarre that it comes with a black cord i have a white kitchen so now i have this stands out like a sore thumb black power cord for aesthetic purposes i was happier with my year old white echo not show because it came with a white powercord this seems like a major design flaw in the white option i strongly urge amazon to change out the powercord to white
works greathaving fun playing musicchecking weathera king questions
love it
i like the hands free operation vs the tap we use both for controlling smart plugs
we have a great time using this as a family even my toddler can talk to her  there are a few features i wish it would learn to do  but overall we love it and glad we brought it over the google home 
so far i like it
this was an impulse buy but turns out i really enjoy my new dot my grands love requesting songs and playing games i like listening to my audible selection keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new alexa skills fun and practical my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home
love it i personally prefer spotify music so it is great that i was able to set that as default there’s not a day that goes by without music in our home also the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave so we tell alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders he’s a lot more calmer and does not bark when we lock the door and start walking away it is a must have
awesome thing love alexa
there's room for improvement on this for the price i cannot complain too much i can still complain however the audio is terrible this is kind of like listening to a speak n spell from the 80s
echo dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it i have unplugged it it feels like it is spying on us
fun so far learning to use her
big step up from the dot dropped one star due to consistent delay in bringing up ring pro video though looks great once the feed is displayed
love it  we have other echoes and love those so i bought this on prime day  no regrets  love that i can connect to my ring and see the front door  yhe kids like seeing the lyrics to songs and sing along 
why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with samsung tv's and many other devices  i want my money back  this thing won't even turn on my tv unless i buy another hub  what is the point of having a hub that does not support half the devices out there  do not buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub  it won't work with many of your devices  just by the echo or dot if you must but not this  better yet get a google device  they actually understand you when you talk
great buy recommend getting kodi with some movie addons
used twice not working
i love it  i made a group with my echo dot so i get music through my home  i am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully i can get another spot for my bedroom  i love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice
still getting used to alexa do not have her connected to our tv yet or other things right now use her for music and information which she is great
i love this it is user friendly and better than any streaming device we have previously used i wish we had purchased sooner and purchased more of them
seems to work ok but no youtube tv  really  can not believe they would ban an app that so many people want to use  i really wanted to like it but when i could not install that particular app it became almost useless almost  does most other stuff just fine but i will stick with my roku
i really love my amazon echo i think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it it is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports
so far it has worked well not always intuitive as to how to link different devices or skills but getting the hang of it
i like it and still learning how to use it
love the speakers and the screen
it was easy set up  i use it more than i thought
love my spot my favorite feature is the alexa start my day i love that i can hear the weather traffic and even the word of the day it even goes right into my favorite podcast while i get dressed
great
 
i am having trouble connecting my tv to it but i am not exactly tech smart i am sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me so far i have been using it mostly for music
very easy to set up and use slowly adding devices to truly make our house a smart home both alexa and i are learning what we can do  with each new item i am happier that i made the purchase  so far my only regret is i did not do it sooner
so far i like it
easy to set up still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug grandkids think alex is cool
it is s great tool helping with information
great product except there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time permanently  when in 'clock' mode the screen rotates between the clock face and a 'things to try' screen  i intended on buying several units for my house but i do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me  acting as clock should be a basic feature of the echo spot  how could you get this wrong amazon  fail
love that you can use your cell phone to call echo or dot you can also use echo and dot as intercoms
i like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the google only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker easy to use
the sound quality wasn’t great but it was inexpensive
i love my alexa dot i play games with my son ask how the weather is and i love that she works with my amazon fire tv
extremely easy to use switched away from directv and use it to stream tv
a great buy
the ase of participating with echo
i have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom it was even easier to set up than my original echo
home
the echo dot was everything that i expected and more
love being able to listen to music easily still learning all the features available
i have not had it very long but so far our whole family is enjoying asking alexa questions
like it to do more
easy to hook up  wish i knew all its capabilities
i love it  i wanted it primarily for the kitchen  in addition to other common services i wanted it to use allrecipes and cook's illustrated recipes
 
bought this on prime day
i just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc the system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming sirius
it does what it is suppose to do great product
from such a small speaker it sounds great
love it l i plan on getting an echo for the kitchen
bought this for my daughter when she turned 9  she loves it  i especially like the calling feature since she does not have a cell phone  she loves playing music and dancing and with amazon music she can play all her favorite songs  sometimes over and over and over again lol
i have been waiting for the echo show to go on sale and it was worth the wait it was easy to set up and start using
great sound
it is great but it would be better there was a way to use headphones with it
the echo show is ok however the constant suggestions about what to ask alexa are sooooo annoying and there is no way to eliminate it also i thought i could have the weather for an area displayed continuously  but i have to talk to alexa which i do not want to do in the middle of the night had i payed full price it would have been returned there are other features that are nice but i may never use them
great product and prime day price took a while to figure out how to connect to my wireless network and the other echo devices in my home this came with a philips smart bulb it is better than having a clapper i found instructions online to 'wake to music & philips light' very easy to set it up with the instructions you even have an option of what song you want to wake up to
i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best i am happy to see they are making improvements with each new oneit would be great to have updates to our little ai's i think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it all in all i am very happy with her and i can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble thank you
love all the options with the fire tv stickworks great
love the echo show the video quality is good and of course sound is good too
needs to be smarter
very nice  i am impressed   wish she had more to say though
same specs as regular echo but easier to use than getting a separate hub for smart lights etc
it is extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it does not answer everything i ask but it is still nice to use
i am still learning how to use it but so far my echo is great the sound is actually much better than i was expecting
very cool product easy to setup fun to use and sound quality is much better than i anticipated
love this just wish it had a built in hub
my son loves his echo dot
the echo dot was easy to set up and use it helps provide music etc to small spaces and was just what i was looking for
in one word amazing best tech purchase i have ever made as it controls all devices in my house and even my pool
too difficult to set up  it keeps timing out before you can enter the password
thanks
love that is can do so much it sits on my nightstand only improvements i would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger but overall i am happy i have it would recommend
works as you’d expect and then some also good sound quality considering price 7000 on sale and features
love it getting use to it and alexa is getting use to my voice  sometimes she does not answer but i think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice isn't strong over all i have not had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about thank goodness i did not listen to those reviews  and paid attention to the apple guy 
the entire family loves alexa echo she’s now a part of this family
besides being fun it also has many practical aspects  a real bonus for those with vision issues
i love it the coolest thing since sliced bread
it is not perfect but i really like this little gizmo i bought it primarily for 2 purposes first so i could set wake up alarms by individual days and set the wake up music individually by the day second i wanted to control a bedroom light by voice so i could shut it off as i was falling asleep without having to get out of bed to turn a switch the echo spot together with a smart plughas been able to accomplish that a bonus has been getting alexa to play music from my amazon prime playlistswhat is not so great is that sometimes alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating hopefully the ai gets better in the future along with added functions
very disappointed when we had to mandatory upgrade and when we final got done with the upload we had lost our local charlotte nc channels which are pur news and weather also  cbs nbc abc and 2 days later was amazon day with discounts on what we had just ordered
always wanted onetill i got one it is not at all what it is cracked up to be it is hard to navigate i actually like the dot better
love the spot   awesome little guy with precise video   i am saving to buy one for my mom on the east coast   the spot changes everything as far as keeping your loved ones connectedwell worth every cent
i wish it did more with internet searches  i do like the feature it has
streaming is easy  i love it because i can watch netflix in my bedroom on my tv and not my ipad
 
up dated news
great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use fun to own
i like that it knows my music typethe least is that it isn't wireless and the volume is not that high
this is pretty cool
i have had all good experience so far with the second generation echo there are so many more things to learn but i have not had the time yet right now i am mostly enjoying the music weather updates using the alarm feature and her personality i have also purchased some mini smart socket yes i am very excited to begin using them
i did not like that almost everytime i asked alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that
great to have along with the echo
so far so good
i do like the product we bought it on prime day but this week it was $30 cheaper then prime day still a really cool device i wish i would have waited
i like the echo but not sure about the dot  i use it a lot for music and audio booksthe sound quality of this smaller echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model  i have not decided if i will keep it or not
happy with echo plus having fun learning what i can do with it
love it though wish it was portable
i already bought one previously to try out and enjoyed it  bought these new ones during the prime sale
everything about it is great love the alexa voice remote
this device is awesome
amazing product still learnimg all the things it can do
works well i have several of these recommend to anyone
i replaced my 1st gen was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same soundi was wrong  if anything it is the same volume and more clear  good product
so far pretty happy with the spot for me it really is a glorified alarm clock radio and i know i could have something more cost effective but eh i like it i had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did so far so good
love it
excellent product mint condition for a refurbished unit   you would never know it is been refurbished
easy set up nice looking interface and i like the new slightly larger remote i have a 1st gen with the little remote and misplace it all the time and great price
i liked the sound  what is troubling is that i paid extra money to have access to a million more songs sometimes it does not work ex alexa play italian songs do not have or don t understand or play the opera tosca response sorry i dont have that
saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected
barry
i had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home my wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer this has been a godsend 100% we have the amazon music for her and now she can listen to music check the weather get phone numbers make calls etc etc we are still learning but i tell you this is absolutely amazing i purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on alexa with the wifi and direct cable capability the speaker stereo options are there for the choosing this is well worth the money you won't regret this at all
very bad this device i do not know if it is because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself  nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking when you talk you have to yell super lauded
easy to use
i bought this because it can control fios television it works well i am hoping over time it will do more to control fios then i discovered all the other things alexa can do play music you ask for great sound from alexa play games play radio stations play old time radio programs like the long ranger alexa has many apps you can add to her abilities the other day i played madlibs great fun also alexa can control household appliances i just purchased alexa compatible power strips to control lighting fans and tv components i am looking forward to implementing this controll you can also add other alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located
this is a great product  set up was easy  sound is wonderful
i received an echo as a gift loved it so much i decided to get the dot for my bedroom both very easy to set up but a big difference in the sound quality i would still buy it again
i am having real difficulty working with the echo dot alexi is not very smart 9 out of 10 questions i have asked i get the i am not sure  half the time i am still asking the question and alexi is saying i am not sure the music is great and works well for that all in all so far it is been a very frustrating experience
everyone should have an echo or two or three or more i bought my echo through qvc
already had an echo dot the echo is even better with fuller sound also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great
very satisfied with the echo alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to jimmy buffet by just asking alexa
the ease in installing
i am still learning how to use the echo but so far i love it
awesome product
upgraded from echo to echo show
the echo dot disconnects from the speaker about 12 20 times a day do not buy the refurbished product  2 stars for effort
more compact and a bit better than the original
awesomeunderstands my kids
great product easy to install and use not a necessity but a commodity
i got this on prime day and figured i would see what all the hype is about  honestly i did not really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird but honestly i love it  like it or not this is the way the world is going so why noti loved it so much i ordered 2  i did not get the show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly  i have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway so the spot's screen does not bother me   although it is very clearalexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere  my favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it is hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar   where i can just say play any song i want and it will  i guess i could just pick up my smartphone to do that but you do not know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pagesthe one thing that i am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much   they also do not rotate when playing music  i would love for it to display the weather as i listen to musicthe screen is clear and i also really enjoy alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be   there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places that you program and name so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents   and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic  i have this programmed for my parents fiances parents work and her work  so it really works greatthe one thing that i actually preferred the dot over the spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications i have not seen the spot really do much for package notifications yet  the dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered  i would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot   the dot lights up colors   why can not the spot   the same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for deliveryoverall it is a great device that i am looking forward to integrating my home around  i am already looking at dash buttons smart plugs etc  and = when i become a home owner instead of renting where i can not tinker with my thermostat i will be purchasing a nest down the road for hvac integration
great
does everything i need
love my echo
love it very much still learning everything that my echo can do but am really enjoying the whole process
if you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the echo dot units simultaneously you must pay a monthly fee i thought this was amazon not apple i have paid for many of these so i could have one in each room is that not enough of my money
looks and works perfect glad i got a good deal
absolutely love it
how can you not like the echo plus  it has the built in hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices  amazon makes a great product and i have not had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices echo dots etc
i have only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital but had good time with it for the short time i did use it it was fun trying to use alexa
i bought this product hoping that alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along therefore expecting her to be responsive this $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her echo buttons manual see step 3 the device has potential given it has a big screen decent sound but for 200 bucks i would never reccomend it even for the $100 i spent i feel like i got shorted oh and lastly the device is pretty useless without a prime membership i linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker i went on the family account this one and got it to work minimal oh and even with our prime membership you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 399 a month leaving this item a subscription nightmare and a overpriced decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes i would give it zero stars if i could
love it
i really love my amazon echo i think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it it is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports
i enjoy the various functions of the device
she works well needs a learning command  for unique owners and users like alexa learn tasha’s birthday  or alexa learn my definition of fine etc other than that she is great
the best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house  there isn’t anything i dislike
great price  i love my echo dot
just what i expected
love it and alexa i am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient
great product what they do not tell you is that once you allow a drop in  they can drop in anytime  while they are sleeping while we are yelling at them while anything
i had just said to myself how i desired an assistant when i came across the spot  as a mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone’s schedules & my own i just verbally tell alexa what reminder or timer i need set and voilahaving my spot has given me the virtual assistant i so desired without having to actually hire someone  not to mention the many other awesome features i have alexa synced with my audible & kindle & alex can read a book from my libraries to mei am still excited to see what else my spot can doside note i had wanted to purchase a show for a while & probably still will down the line however i sooooo love my sleek little sopt
love it very helpful
love it but the volume could definitely use a boost if it had better built in speaker's would definitively be a 5 star they thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input so i bought a dedicated speaker for the echo proved to be best way to go
the echo is wonderful but i am still learning how to use it music requests are somewhat limited
the echo is an amazing device  many times it seems very intuitive  but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result  installation was fairly straightforward but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it was not  this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out  my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next stepmy biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done  however i can not make any of the echos aware of the others existence  when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name  i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions  a small deal for many device savvy people but a challenge for me
the sound quality is great it now replace the echo dot in my kitchen
i cant figure out how to use it
my mom bought a few echo dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great i told her no for two days when she made me take it 6 hours later i could not live my life without it  it is that amazing so now we have four large speakers and only the small echo dot that i will be returning to her i say if you’re going to order an alexa speaker go big and get the echo otherwise tou’ll be returning the two echo dots you could not live without
works great can not tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode  i have 3 in my home and will be adding more i love these things
perfect  fast shipment and packaging  worked as intended
love these
i do not have alexa but after getting this i am feeling inspired to get one i feel this is a good gateway and or alexa trial and liking it so far  channels work just fine like apple tv just need to check if there is a phone app for a keyboard typing because spelling things out on keyboard sucks for searching youtube clips
very fast service  got what i ordered thank you
i love my echo plus
no problems whatsoever makes life easy and sounds great
i love love love it
it was easy to set up and affordable love it
very pleased with the echo 2nd generation it is so nice to have alexa available for music weather news and probably a lot more we have not discovered
i have had no problems with my echo plus would purchase it again
our family really loves this new echo
i love it it is compatible with many of my cameras and it does everything that the echo dot does
i love it it plays my sleep sounds immediately when i ask
works great with my existing smart home setup
refurbish echo dot received as new condition as new packaging no complaints neat little gadgetdrives my wife nuts
love
love the alexa feature firestick is working just fine
love my echo show  everything about this device is wonderful
i love alexa she rocks
love the music the stories
omg where do i start i love this thing none bad to say
this worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet wifi and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked  amazon customer service could not help further and told me warranty was only 3 months which was very disappointing so they weren't willing to replace
great addition to our breakfast room kitchen  tunes and information instantly available  slowly learning more features
i think it can read my mind
this was a replacement of an older version of fire stick i have not tried the alexa voice part of this remote yet but it works great
i have had the first gen echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me i purchased the 2nd gen during prime day and so far i am happy it seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such
cheap and cheap sound
just like new
 
good hearing range and sound quality it was a bit complicated to set up and she does not quite understand me a lot even when i am speaking slowly and clearly but i love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system
the ease to use product
great product   understands my accent
love it just as good as a new one
fairly useless
 
new device so still learning about it but works great for us when navigating hulu
i do not think the 2nd gen sounds as good as the 1st  but it does have an aux out so you could add an external speaker  but if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot  2nd issue is which isn't unique to this unit but i do not understand why i can not override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a group  i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker  but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker
it is like a remedial form of the star trek computer in your home
i love my echo spot
availability of movies and nothing i do not like
i love my echo spot  waking to my favorite music  being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark  all the skills i have yet to try  easy to use
i have been wanting one of these for a while now  bought on prime day and absolutely love it
i enjoy it still discovering new uses
simply love my echo i hardly watch any tv at all anymore i am too busy listening to music speaker is pretty goo for its size all the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family
i returned 2 echo dots & am only getting refund for 1 i returned 2 in one package i want my refunds for both of them they are in the same package can you not see them both
it works great and sounds good
i connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my google home mini can not do  it works well
oh i love my echo show and the video news spots
still learning all the ways to use it  it is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it  5 and 7 yrs  very cute
i love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too great for family game nights
still getting used to alexa but i think she's a keeper
this echo is just as great as my others even though it is smaller
i am a small business owner with no staff with the alexa driven echo spot i feel like i have hired my first assistant my echo spot keeps me organized updated and assistance when i need information that will help my day run more smoothly i love my echo spot so much i bought 2 more for my kids who love their echo spot too i highly recommend this productsuggested improvement for future versions make the echo spot wireless 😊
thought it was pretty cool new to streaming thing seemed easy to use
love it
easy to use and setup
easy to use  amazing
it plays music that i request
easy setup easy use work with other smart products always learning what it can do
listening to music searching locations checking time looking up weather there are many more task to learn it was simple to set up
was leary about refurbished but work great
family loved it
i bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs but i have no need for it i only used it once the volume was not loud enough for me when i played music while i was on my treadmill so i rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder
amazing product with amazing sound
i have never been more satisfied with a product perfect introduction to alexa
my mom bought a few echo dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great i told her no for two days when she made me take it 6 hours later i could not live my life without it  it is that amazing so now we have four large speakers and only the small echo dot that i will be returning to her i say if you’re going to order an alexa speaker go big and get the echo otherwise tou’ll be returning the two echo dots you could not live without
sound is terrible cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously  must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time
great product and fast shipping thank you
perfect for kids adults and everyone in between
sound quality
i purchased this refurbished  works just like brand new  3 minute set up very easy  now i have echo dot that i can command to start playing music for my backyard deck sound system
 
nice picture good sound but the mics are not as sensitive as a dot my dots can hear me from across the house the show does not that being said i love the showi can watch tv and movies while in tg ed kitchen have the news playing or musicloveit 
i love searching the alexa skill shop on the app useful things like having alexa turn my lights on and off listening to news updates every morning and fun stuff like telling alexa to make the star trek red alert nois or playing song quiz with friends
once connected it brought so many options to view we connected with quite a few of the channelsmust have
 
whats not to like about this speaker  just ask alexa
a great product  i would buy another
the only thing i do not like is it shuts off by itself other than that it works great
great product highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it it sits much better on the desk
this is outstanding works awesome the music sound very clear and loud and alexa is very smart
i bought this for my mother and she is in love with itshe loves the guard dog featureshe says that it gives her a sense of security at night and when she leaves the house
i like it and it is helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon
holy sound quality batman this thing jams it is insanely helpful and just a nice gadget to have around
the commands alexa requires are too specific  i find google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what i am asking for
needs to play youtube and prime video and maybe netflix but it has good sound
the selection is wonderful and the ease of use on the home page is nice i wish however it did not keep overcoming my settings for my other devices attached to my tv  i have to keep switching back after any switches in programming including my stereo
i love my echo  works just like they said it would i do not have a smart home so i cannot speak about that function but everything else about it is good
love that you can use your cell phone to call echo or dot you can also use echo and dot as intercoms
have these in almost every room i really have enjoyed them works perfectly
it was harder to setup then i thought it should be for some reason i had to default  it twice had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices would be nice if it could interact with my xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras be nice set and disarm the alarm with alexa had to install a skill app to setup bulb  whats that about you ship it with your product  should have said alexa setup bulb or alexa find new bulb  and alexa setup nest it is fine that you use third party apps but alexa should do the work for you
it is smaller than the original looks nicer too
i love it
not all that happy the speaker isn’t great and for some reason a lot of times when i play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop my son has a google home and it is much better
the echo works well i was able to sync it with my other amazon music devices
we have 3 echos now even one in the barn great idea for when i am working with my horse can still get news flashes & my music
i needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly  i am a believer in amazon echo alexa and fire  great customization options and alexa is always helpful  sound quality is also surprisingly good
i love it
love our echo thing the full size version sounds better though
great sound from a little speaker
she works well needs a learning command  for unique owners and users like alexa learn tasha’s birthday  or alexa learn my definition of fine etc other than that she is great
i love it works very well
easy to use and has great soundit was a great purchase at a great price
i bought it mainly to be a speaker when playing music or videos on my phone not working for me read instructions but not working for me
i like almost everything
amazing product
i used chromecast before this it was okay but i love the firestick works great does not lag would recommend
works well just disappointed with the speaker quality but hooked it up to old computer speakers
the built in hub lacks some of the features geo fencing of the phillips hub  otherwise would have given it 5 stars
 
puts the pep back in my old tv  all of the software was expired and i enjoy netflix and amazon prime video  now i have all of my favorite video on the tv again
love  love my echo plus   so silly simple to set up   alexa has now become my new bff  amazon 24 7 support is hard to beat   any questions answered any time  what more can you ask for 
this is my second echo i have the dot but the speaker is weak so i purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great
we love our echo show
very easy to install and am excited to use
having the large screen really majes this an enjoyable experience only thing it is missing is youtube
worked just like a brand new dot    so i am very satisfied
love it
you’re all i needna na nana
great product had a bit of a problem to download kodi but once it is done you get all the movies tv programs
got this on amazon prime with the ring pro work really great being the lazy guy i am i do not need to go see who at my door anymore while i am gaming
this is my first alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation
i like it
alexa is perfect for people like me living alone at least i have someone to talk to to keep my sanity though i wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers
these are great i bought one and then bought another right away grab a few of these and a few smart switched and you're set with smart home capabilities for under $150 highly recommended
i love the firestick  it is easy to set up and use it rarely stops to buffer and it  would be a bargain at twice the price
does everything i have asked it
i love my echo dot  the price i paid during prime day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles but this does so much more  i can play music set alarms call friends play games set timersthe list goes on and on  definitely worth the money
great price  i love my echo dot
i like that it responds every time it was easy to set up  i am still learning what i can do with it i may like a better speaker more
 
still learning everything she can do  good for a room  volume is pretty good without an additional speaker
listens well does way more than expected love her
i like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality i expected
it was very easy to set up and my family love it is
when you think about it this really does not do much play music answer stupid questions finally it was able to hook up to thermostat i can see why price is dropping like a rock
love it  works perfectly
amazing for all your entertainment needs
alexa's sister my second dot
i own 5 echo devices consider me addicted this little number is awesome not only do i like that it displays the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other echo devices one feature i really like is how it slowly dims after i turn off my bedroom light so i have a night light for a bit i love echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them
great sound and video plus all the great stuff that alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off
very nicely constructed my wife wanted a second for the kitchen so i order a second one
i really love that all my apps are in one spot
love it  it works great  alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day  i am not an expert but i think the sound quality is fine  not perfect but good
i liked it perfect size the screen is really clear  and elegant
i love my new echo dot right now i mainly use it to play music at night but it gets the job done
the sound quality is not that good especially for the price that you pay for this i would recommend to get the echo dot and buy a better speaker instead maybe sonos and use the echo dot
it is awesome i love being able to turn my lights on so i do not have to walk into a dark home i also get to video chat with my nephews who live states away by just asking alexa to call
i love it
love it very helpful
liked 100%
sad joke worthless
bought my first echo dot and loved it so i got this for work absolutely love it
it is like having another kid in the house i have to constantly repeat myselfi can tell alexa to do something clear as day and according to the history she hears something comeletely differentthe device is really cool and i like the concept which is why it gets two stars however it just does not work as intendedi find myself irritated more often than not when i use this device
just got mine last night played around with it for a while should have bought it a long time ago
small device that my kids like to ask questions very handy friendly interactive
this was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad he loves it ask alexa anything she has the answer plus it is good for homework so i purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when i am getting ready for work i listen to music at 4am and the base it is metro booming replacement for my clock radio plus i have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock
works beautifully excellent sound
very easy to set up works wonderful and i love it
works great
i was a little nervous when i received my new echo as i am not really tech savvy i found it a bit intimidating at first but it did not take me to long to figure it out i am very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot
works really well
great device
i love the echo plus mainly because i do not have to worry about putting a cd in to play i just command a song and it plays however i was disappointed to learn later that it needed to stay plugged in unlike the echo after consulting with amazon and learning that i can purchase a portable echo charging station i am goodsincerely
it is an echo and it works  for the price it is great deal have had no issues with it  as with all dots the speaker is a bit tinny but good for a second unit or if you are like me you can attach it to an external speaker for more soundgood buy
it is alright
i love alexa it is great helping me making my appointments playing the songs i like what else can you do looking forward for more
it is my second one so i put this one in the kitchen for recipes
listen music and set timer
i bought this for my healing room  i play continuous spa like music although alexa knows the type of music needed the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled  i did not know i had to buy speakers too
has weird pauses in her speech pattern that are not present in my other echo devices
love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen great to drop in on family around the house
an outstanding piece of technology i use it everyday for information scheduling and general information  awesome amazon keep improving with ai
connecting and sound are perfect i only give 4 because the is no internal battery if i disconnect to the power source it will be off
not that much different than the one we had  alexa is still stubborn lol  we ordered it on the prime day to get the light bulbs with it i the deal but did not get the light bulbs  when we called she said they were sold out  felt bad about that  now we have to buy light bulbs
mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result
so far i like it  it is better than i expecting it
it still does not work  i bet if i call and let them know that they will charge me for the 3rd time  ridiculous
cool
great buy
my first smart buyi am loving it and all the great things alexa can do
not much features
love the spot
the tech isn’t there it does not understand most common words and is basically a glorified radio
excellent quality very good sound great deal on prime day
does not seem to hear as well as my 2nd generation echo and why is there no volume buttons on it
worked great the built in hub works great
works very well but the microphone dont pick up as well as the full size echo  audio quality is okay for the size
some times alexa is a little thick but mostly good
 
 
currently own 3 chromecast devices and tge fire stick is superior to them  we are so pleased that we can watch programs on netflix and prime without a smart phone or computer  very easy to install and use
everything perfect
it is got great sound and bass but it does not work all of the time its still hot or miss when it recognizes things
entertainment
awesome life changer seriously i am able to start my morning with alexa by having her wakeme up with  her alarm and then playing me some music she has gotten used to my voice that i can be in another room and she will listen to what i say i love both my echos do not hesitate get one and for the price the speaker is unbelievable i am buying the cordless holder so i can take the echo anywhere love my purchase and love alexa
hard to hear had to blue tooth it to a better speaker
like having the music where ever i am
the speakers on these devices are surprisingly good the functionality of each echo device is fantastic
i use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information
love the firestick my kids love that they can talk to alexa and get the weather local news etc
of course
 
like new  no difference from new unused original
perfect may favorite alexa device by far specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam's it does the job really well  we changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive good job amazon
i love this answers all my stupid questions and tells me the weather for when i do not get off the couch
it does not always  work
works great speed is fast exactly what we needed
i like having more alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting
i use it primarily to play music  it works wonderfully  still getting used to some of the many things it will do  amazon has sent several tips since i got it thanks for all your help
its okay but keeps dropping wifi
not very loud but quality and ease of use is great sound is perfect for background music would suggest 2 or more connected together if you’re trying to use for hosting a louder party
i like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart tv if i ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if i ask you to change the channel it does or does not sometimes i have to reset it i do not know if it is because it is refurbished but it is okay it is just not what i expected
love being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs
i was not sure i really wanted one of these but now that i have it it is extremely useful  get one you'll love it
 
very nice everything is working fine just have to 100% learn the commands
 
stopped working after 2 weeks did not follow commands really fun when it was working
this is the one of my favorite amazon devices  have one in my bedroom and use as alarm clock perfect addition to our home of alexa devices
works great exactly as described only complaint i have is sometimes alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff
alexa is easy to operate and set up  have had it for about 10 days now and love it
the price is great  was having trouble with it hearing me from across a room but after moving it to another spot it seems to be working fine  will buy some more want 1 in every room
i have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock it is the perfect bedside counter device   alarm wake up music weather top news stories etc perfect device for what i wanted and does so much more than i expected it to do calling feature is also a huge selling point this is a must own item probably will grab more echos in the future
love
i never had alexa before but the biggest reason i bought it was for youtube and apparently youtube stopped supporting it and that is why it will get 4 stars it is mostly youtube's fault but i worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist
you need a harvard law degree to operate this thing it is going back very soon
so easy to use non stop music
alexa hardly came on
i love it  it is so easy to use
love seeing everything in the display
still learning all the capabilities but so far pretty pretty pretty good
good product
i love my firestick
works great
works great no lag and is much better than the gen 1 devices i was using i would recommend this if you have a 1rst gen and are tired of the lag and crashes
best father's day gift dad joked to my mom that alexa will be the one listening to all of his repeated stories going forward
love it the only downside is that you can not download any app you want
very easy to set up and have no issues
once set up very user friendly set up was not as user friendly as i would hoped the alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers my wife and i are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install alexa but if my son was not supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using alexa yet
all is fine with the spot exact for one massive failing  in order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk   which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like  yes you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss then you completely delete your recurring alarmthis is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off  but as the clock has been out for a year now and they still have not adding this setting clearly not going to happen  this may be the biggest product design screw up amazon has ever made
no problems
works great perfect for my office
as always easy to set up
menu does not work says it can not connect to amazon network
i am sure the echo is as cool as everyone saysbut i won't get to try this one even though i have a large covered porchthe package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rainand rain it did soaking the package i am not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is this order has been cursed from the beginning ordered as a birthday gift and delivery was not made on scheduled day now i get it and its rain soaked
it is alexa what else can you say
great product and i like the screen for a alarm clock
i love it i use it for everything it is a part of my daily routine
i received the echo as a gift i needed another bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible and found this smart speaker can not wait to see what else it can do
love the echo dot helps husband get netflix and other apps on our amazon fire tv  no problems with it being refurbished planning on getting another one for the amazon fire stick in bedroom
sound is better
my new best friend i am a little behind the times i have never had anything like this another alexa or google home so to me this is a super amazing useful tool i use it to play sleep sounds to sleep i use it for my amazon audible books set alarms reminders receive notifications play games with her have her tell me a short story lol it is pretty fun i know some people complained about the speaker i am not sure why i am sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough but i rent a room and in my bedroom it is perfect i do not have any problems with the speaker love everything about it
upgraded from an original echo on prime day and so far i love it i am sure i have a long way to go to maximize its utility  but for now i owe my marked increase in lyrical knowledge to this thing who knew post malone actually used words
setting up
sound is terrible cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously  must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time
i love you so much
this is a great device we mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list but occasionally use any number of the fun things you can program it to do like go to red alert or make the tardis land yes we are a house of geeks we even chose the wake word to be computer instead of alexa now we just need majel barret's voice and i will be in geek heaven it is not as easy to get my premium spotify to work properly with it and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms but so far it is still been worth it i am often asking it the time the weather it even gives us a news briefing we also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome plus it is fun knowing the nsa is listening to everything
it has all i need for my life plans time date music
i purchased echo about 2 weeks ago  i love this product i would definitely recommend
we have used for last 2 weeks we like it my children also like it alexa has become part of our family
it is like having your tv as a big tablet
got this as a gift so cool  i can view my news recipes or shopping lists  and much more
love my echo dot easy to use and set up
 
divertido
love it to play music works great for finding recipes need more family to have adapted machines to see
still learning everything she can do  good for a room  volume is pretty good without an additional speaker
i love it
dislike the volume it does not sound loud enough
no problem
love the echo dot it is amaxing
works great alexa finds all the goodies you could ask for
love this
you can not access youtube why do consumer's have to pay for this argument why can not we just have a good product that offers what we need
great purchase
it is a great bundle of fun music games questions etc i luv it turns off my smart lights i purchase 4 more smart light for my lamps in the living room and my room
i am impressed with the sound quality
i love the way it is designed and you have choices for the face  i use it for my bed side  i drop in on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling
works great
super easy set up great features fun
we really only use this as a speaker to stream music we have had it 7 months and it is just kinda useless
it was very easy to set up and my family love it is
highly like my eco showno complaints
home entertainment
45 out of 5 stars i generally like this product its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music setting timers and making calls reason why i did not rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my echo stops playing music and shows a red ring seems to be a connection issue overall great product
music news shopping list jokes games
i had some trouble with my echo dot when i first got it because of internet connection issues after doing research online i saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation echo dot however the same weekend i took a trip and brought my echo dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine now back home the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it is little rough patch and i have not had any problems since so if you are having connection issues with an echo dot then it is probably the internet and not the device
i love this it is quick and easy to use i love that there are so many apps you can access but disappointed some of them cost extra money to use i also love the music app on here i did not think i would use it because i have alexa echo and listen to music all the time on there but i tried it on the fire tv and it gives you the lyric as the songs play love it
in a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house extrimelly useful hub of information music automation communication and assistant in basic needs would love to have a voice personalization some things are better not to said aloud but typed like door unlocking codes but that is problem of unwitty developers so far only positive experience the privacy invasions is happened way before alexa it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier to alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off
i am happy with the refurbished echo dot i have had it for about two weeks and so far it is working perfectly even though it did not come in its original box it looks like new i am happy with this purchase
love it
easy to use
works like any other one
fun just got it today now my i pod will go in my car and i will use this is the house
fast response which was amazing  clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic  i am still getting used to alexia and have not usde echo to its full extent
need to be able to connect to more 3rd party viceo apps
i used it as an alarm clock  i lov it
alexa show is amazing my wife hated that i bought it thought we did not need it and after a day she fell in love with alexa too lol it is so convenient for setting timers listening to music playing music for the dog while im not home connecting to bluetooth speakers for parties playing movies i love it
very pleased with the echo 2nd generation it is so nice to have alexa available for music weather news and probably a lot more we have not discovered
i have the dot and echo plus this one can not seem to hear me as well and does not do as much as i expected
i love my amazon sticks
echo is my teacher english he is very funnybut sometimes he does not listen to what is said
great device  seems to work better than the 1st generation
i purchased the show  to keep in touch with my daughter and her family after their recent move half way across the country  it is wonderful seeing their faces during our conversations
love the dots especially with the ability to talk from one to the other these are really convenient no issues with the refurbished as they are like new
i was really happy with my original echo so i thought i would get an echo dot to use in my bedroom i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi presumably due to interference from the bluetooth then  i connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack when i did that the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound im hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device
love itso happy to have everything available through this
it is annoying that everything they show alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded you spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself
it good
perfect for controlling my tp link smart devises
it is pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but does not understand my commands some of the time
arrived on time and works amazing
arrived right on time and works as expected
love it works great making my home a smarthome
echo show   white&nbspgreat new addition to our alexa home solution and now i can call back home and video chat directly from my phone great way to stay in touch with family
good sometimes can not hear well
it makes talking with your grandchildren so easy especially for the little ones  outstanding product
great product we listen to music all the time
i really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens i have no complaints at this time
it is still a great productbut the sound quality does seem worsedo not get me wrong you definitely get used to it within an hour but it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was betterbesides that  it is greatwith the addition of being able to play just over bluetooth with no wifi it is even better
easy to use all your favorite programs all inclusive nothing else to buy
as you can see echo show is in kitchen it far exceeds my expectation there’s a wealth of information about any topic if is customizable for sound and video i also have echo and echo dot you can group them and have hole house music still not done exploring all it can do love it perfect for getting recipes so you can see them while you’re preparing to cook
my  wife & i enjoy the ease of playing our music the games are fun & entertaining i look forward to adding more smart products to my home
i love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier
amazing it has helped me become better organized gives me traffic updates weather updates and helps me maintain a good fast morning routine
 
too soon i am still learning what i can do with it
good as new just like brand new save yourself some money get one
a great product for the price works well
great product love the larger remote great deal
best purchase this year
fun
i am amazed with the alarm i tell alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does  i love the play list if music not sure if i do not keep prime if music will still be available however i did love the fact amazon gave me music free for 3 monthsthey should have given prime free for 3 months as well
great sound quality works well with smart home devices
love the dot
i like that it responds every time it was easy to set up  i am still learning what i can do with it i may like a better speaker more
i like it
works as advertised very easy to setup still learning what this can do
we got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired  it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once i did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff  it should do text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the web by voice so he wouldn't feel left out and isolated  they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the echo so tech support can help setup the device  i had to get a friend whos an it guy to come help me setup
my 90 year old mom loves that she can watch the 1st season of blue bloods ❤ my one wish is that she could watch csimiamiwithout having to pay for it😥 the bill for optimum is already quite high can you help us we live on long island ny suffolk county 
one problem you need to buy an app from amazon to mirroring your iphone  app price 299$  other than that the device is perfect
i love the alexa remote and easy to use
goes great with our echo
no habla espanol
purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do  so far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform  am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides
works great as a bt receiver with output connected to vintage stereo equipment
great product
i love this as a second alexa in our bedroom  great for checking weather for meditation music and as a timer   perfect for my husband who has to use eye drops multiple times each day and keep his eyes closed for 5 minutes
set up is so easy
ease of usage
hard to hear had to blue tooth it to a better speaker
great price to extend the range and super value to dot offers hooked up wireless speaker to use working outsidethis dot made outdoor sound range possible without disturbing indoor light control possible
i love my echo  works just like they said it would i do not have a smart home so i cannot speak about that function but everything else about it is good
 
was working great útil 1 week algo í have it for a month but it started flickering  and in the support forums they say it is a known isue  but it has more the 4 months reported and there is no solución
have now used for several months without problem
able to watch all of the shows i love and more
we love this thing i wish i would have gotten it sooner you will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework there are loads of skills i am very happy with this purchase especially since i got it on prime day for almost half price
alexa is amazing great speaker
honestly it is no different from the echo dots i already own  other then occasionally seeing the lyrics to a song i am listening too i really do not see the difference
worked like new  will do it again
love it still learning makes a lot of things easier like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask alexa to turn the light off
i am not super impressed with alexa when my prime lapsed she wouldn't play anything she isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can not use it for that either she randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her just today i unplugged hernot sure i will ever use my alexa again
great product
this is my first digital assistant so i am giving this a good review speaker is really good for the cheap price on prime day fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock that's what i was going to get in the first place but i ended up with echo if you have not had a go with one then definitely try itwhat i like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with my purchase came with a smart plug for $10 which i connect my lamp to alexa turn of the lights
i have had this for a little over 3 weeks now and i absolutely love it it is so easy to use i am basically using it as a smart alarm but it can do way more the screen quality is great and it looks super cute sitting on my night stand i do not know how i lived without it so long if you can not decide whether to buy it or not go for it you won’t regret it
sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose
i highly recommend the spot i have it connected to the kasa camera and it is so convenient to just ask spot to show me the camera when someone is at the door love it as soon as amazon has a good sale on these again i will be getting another one good job amazon
love my echo show alexa is amazing and now on the show she can display lyrics photos etc the speakers are amazing and fills the room bought on prime day so got a great deal so worth it
amazing so far just got it the other day
i loved how easy this was to install sry up and use simply amazing  so amazing we bought twothis allowed us to officially cut the cable cordlove it
we love it bought the light bulbs as well and we use it daily
love it even though i am still trying to figure out all the other things i can do with this item it works great with my phone
this is a gift  but i have one and love it  the words to songs are great and the i live the face i chose for the clock  this is my favorite echo unless i am listening to music
super fun  i ty is what i was expecting
exactly as advertised
great speaker i n this i love this so much more than my alexa tap it is definitely fast in response and just so much prettier
i absolutely love this very user friendly and i got the kasa cam to go with it to monitor my living room super easy to set up and operate i only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately i am looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces i like digital but i miss the colon in between the hours and minutes on most of them i would also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices i really have no complaints i am being nit picky at this point worth every penny
great product very versatile and easy to use
get rid of the thongs to try screen numb nuts
i am still learning how to use it but so far my echo is great the sound is actually much better than i was expecting
love it just wish i could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription
awesome cute and smart
this thing barely works you have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you'd think it could do out of the box i am sending mine back asap waste of money
i am thoroughly enjoying my ecoo  love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then i can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more
this is my fourth echo original and two dots it is the best decent speaker fun graphics
works great easy set up
it performs pretty much as expected but i am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology i need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the amazon music service  i understand my music choices may be limited but without knowing how to ask i cannot access the music that is provided free along with my echo purchase  do you have a chart showing the language i need to use
i love this thing the alexa feature makes it so easy to find what you want no matter which streaming service has it  no more searching netflix then amazon etc to see if either has your show  alexa finds it for you
i am never disappointed with amazons technology
is great having a new friend
just like the other one
i love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier
have only had it set up for a few days still adding smart home devices to it the speaker is great for playing music i like the size we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it is not intrusive to look at
i love having alexa around the house my favorite features are her timers alarms and music especially her library of sleep sounds i got this product as a gift for my kids and they love her too she is great for reading time and timing 30 minutes for itthe only thing i really do not like is that she has to be plugged in to an outlet to function no ifs ands or buts i get why but it is minorly inconvenient as i have to move her from room to room or purchase more lol
setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock
i love my new echo  it gives me hours of music and help with other thingsit was difficult for me to set it up  i had to have help from a tekkie
item has never worked out of box it is broken spent several days trying to get it working and running same fixes from amazon the only thing accomplished is i will never order another refurbished device
it does not pick up my voice unless i yell most times
love it  great fun
tried to play certain broadway shows like camelot and it gives ne the group camelot
fun to use good sound quality
i like everything about it 
fun tech toy
it was an excellent purchase echo plus has sound quality good size i love it i it
great sound
nice product a+
works perfect there’s no difference at all between this refurb one and my new ones that i have in my house i will be buying the refurbs from here on out
it seems easy to stump alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer  we admit that we have not explored all that's available through the echo  one irritating issue is that alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system rather it refers you to the alexa app or help via a computer  it was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful
for the price the product is nice quality and has a few nice features so definitely no complaints there the reason why i only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what i thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error first i did not know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work so i really do not like that it is not a stand alone device also the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a bluetooth speaker do not lastly i am sure the echo dot can do a lot but i have not quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own plus setting it up was awful i would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually alexa
it is easy to set up and use there are new features and skills added all the time
works as expected
i bought two refurbished ones for work and home they both work perfectly and appear brand new
its very nice
speaker could be better qualty
love it i was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered i could not pass it up it is fun to ask alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from amazon prime music you can also connect your iphone with bluetooth and play music with pandora or youtube videos using alexa as a speaker i have been having fun asking alexa different types of questions or for information like weather news or even the time in other countries the only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan because alexa uses burns it up when playing music
love my echo love playing music in my room
the volume is very low
love the firestick thinking about canceling the satellite
works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability
great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use fun to own
from such a small speaker it sounds great
we like it all so far but have a lot to try out yet
i am really enjoying the many different features on my alexa especially listening to music and audio books
it is great sound and video quality
