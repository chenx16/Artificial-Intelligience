just the perfect cost effective solution  thank you amazon
i purchased the fire stick to be able to watch movies at my convenience i love that there is such a variety of genres i also enjoy it gives you the ability to watch tv shows too it is awesome
i am very unhappy with this firestick every time we change programs or channels within a program there is a very long delay we have 2 roku’s that work just fine and are very quick
handy if you do not expect much out of it much dumber than the assistant in my phone
good quality great sound quality
this is just like new    same performance as our brand new one no problems
no you tube wouldn't have bought it if i known that
use it all the time and love it very quality product
i sent it to my 85 year old dad and he talks to it constantly
echo dot is a wonderful invention we love it alexa is so smart
i have had pure fun with my echo  weather jokes news briefing and music but still so much more to use it for  a lot of fun for the money
great sound easy set up looks cool
it works great
we really love our echo dot we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of
we love our echo we were totally amazed at the speaker quality only bummed we did not buy two since we got it on prime day
better sound than my echo dot simple to set up less than 5 minutes
great product i have two and may want to buy a third
see subject line  love it
two weeks after setting it up it no longer works  no connection no light no sound  i guess i shouldn't have purchased a refurbished dot
it worked like a brandnew unit great addition to my collection
i loved it does exactly what it says
this is our second echo spot   to go with out two echo dots   love the look and how alexia responds
so far using it for lights and music will connect my tv vacuum and doorbell soon love it
item no longer works after just 5 months of use will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests
great product
fun
i love it
works great
i love this device makes life easier the more you figure out it can do
my kids love alexa skills are amazing would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions
love it as i do all of my echos
the echo works fine but then you get indundated with things to try i am not a 10 year old that needs stimulus to tell me to do things i found there is no way to turn this off except for  turning off the screen if i cannot find a suitable fix for this it goes back
part of it is my fault i thought it could be wireless  though for the price i still feel like it should be also the sound quality and volume could be better i prefer the tap unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones computers or ipads just not worth it
does what i expected and more
yet another exho for our home and love them all
third echo dot purchased love the product
we are still testing this one out and so far we like it i was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first unfortunately it sometimes gets our wifi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we have been able to manage and fix it i mean it is convenient especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the dot i do like that it plays music and has reminders alarms etc   i am just still getting used to the fact that the man is always listening now
awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life great purchase
i like that it is voice activated but it do not link with any other bluetooth devices only alexa devices
need a few more
works as advertised it says alexa is always learning that's great because i am just learning all the things alexa can do
the ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by google search has spoiled mei had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the echonot so the ability of alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the packageperhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates
music mainly but still checking other features
given as a gift to my wife to compliment my echo  she loves it
easy setup works flawlessly
 
worked as promised
beyond awesome
the echo is an amazing device  many times it seems very intuitive  but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result  installation was fairly straightforward but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it was not  this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out  my advice is to be patient the app will let you know when you can move on to the next stepmy biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms which i am told can be done  however i can not make any of the echos aware of the others existence  when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name  i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions  a small deal for many device savvy people but a challenge for me
easy to install up and running in minutes
i definitely like this product  wanted to be able to watch netflix on my tv  easy to install
very nice needs some work
i love the echo dot so easy so fun i get to drop in on my grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away sounds like she is right next to me
perfect
great product
good
love my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker  the return process still isn't done and has already taken weeks
3rd dot love it
i have only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital but had good time with it for the short time i did use it it was fun trying to use alexa
was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all
easy to set up ready to use in minutes
absolutely love
love this  have it in the kitchen and works well
i love the size of the echo spot it fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show i like going to sleep with the lightening storm the images along with the sounds are very relaxing the calling and messaging feature is great it is small enough to take with when we travel i love and own most of the alexa products our whole family uses them
working great and my daughter loves it
works absolutely great
we talk to her all the time for songs and just because we can  there aren’t dislikes about this device
loved it no more cable bills for us  i would advise anyone to get one 2nd one bought
sound quality is great still learning about all the different things i can do with it fun
got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updatesit is far from being usefulhalf the time when you wake the device to ask a question or initiate a command it does not hear what you say and turns off basically ignoring you often she is unable to answer basic questionsit is been so frustrating alexa has been more work rather than making my life easieri would return it but i am past the return period zzzz
we have owned a number of echo devices but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool  other than playing music through a sound system we have not found much use for them  we just do not find the voice user interface to be all that efficient  the echo spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you're routinely interested in  furthermore you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings  we now use these as bedside clocks
my android would not allow alexa to connect fortunately my sister was here with her apple cell after an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches we are up and running
love alexa love the echo dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom
easy to install
works perfect save a few bucks and buy the refurbished looks brand new
already had a firestick in our livingroom great entertainment had to get one for the bedroom
i love it
echos are great i have a few of them through out our home   all in voice range to ask a question say a command to turn lights on or off or my favorite is play music all though the house
amazing device
easy set up
fun to interact with
still need more ai built into it to interact better it needs to continue the conversation sometimes if the finding   answer needs to be right you can not keep stop alexa and ask again and again also it should be able to access the wikipedia dictionary in many areas with better and fast accessneeds to hear us better also we should be able to name it on our own instead calling alexa or echo price can be reduced a bit value based and updates should be auto and daily to improve it  connectivity to other home equipment can be imrproved as wellgood product with good sound quality but needs more ai built in
i think this is the 5th one i have purchased i am working on getting one in every room of my house i really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all echos and controlling the lights throughout my house
the only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality  a massive difference from the alexa  which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase thiswon’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve
great addition to the alexa family just wish it could use the screen more than backgrounds do not get me wrong i do not regret buying it especially for the primeday sale of $100 off sale price but for now the skills for the show are lacking
love it
iove it i bought it for my son because he wanted it and it is awesome
i have not had it very long it is my first alexa thing i sure like what i have done with it so far there is a lot to learn and play with
everyone should have an echo or two or three or more i bought my echo through qvc
very convenient
i love it i can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz not easy to find on local radio sound is good and i can stop it with a voice command if i get a phone call
as described and received on time  do not like automatic enrolment into music
great for checking in on my son after school when i am still at work  love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so i can plan my route accordingly
we love our echo we were totally amazed at the speaker quality only bummed we did not buy two since we got it on prime day
i love my echo show  and now i have this in my bedroom and it is wonderful music info sleeping sounds
have had for just one week so far and i can say it is a blast to have
i love my new echo spot
love it   am using it strictly for music now and it is great
used to have fun with great to play music turn on lights and who know what else
love it i personally prefer spotify music so it is great that i was able to set that as default there’s not a day that goes by without music in our home also the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave so we tell alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders he’s a lot more calmer and does not bark when we lock the door and start walking away it is a must have
great product i just wish it had some sort of equalizer the bass is a little much
very pleased
meh
nice
it works ok this speaker quality is not much better than my iphone x i would spend the extra money to get the full size echo which has great sound quality
too soon i am still learning what i can do with it
just got my third one love them
wish it would have came with the lightbulb but otherwise works great fast delivery and i enjoy using it
love love this new little gadget  has  made our lives so much easier  it is like having our own personal secretary living here in the home  we hardly need our cd's anymore since alexa plays everything we need  going to get the alexa dots soon for more rooms  thanks
i do not like that it goes into sleep mode after 20 30 minutes of inactivity i shouldn’t have to wake up the fire tv to finish watching a show
nice add on to a homewhat i do not like are the limitations for example world soccer it won't give you much info of sport teams other than american
it works just like my other dots
works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for alexa does not work as well as the normal echo  sometimes alexa does not hear me when i try to interrupt her it to give new instructions  the speaker also isn't as good as the normal echo  screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who is at the front door  but it is great for the bedside
i only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb  when i got everything set up i realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb  all it does is turn the light on off and dim  it will not change colors  you still have to have a hue bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb  i wish i would bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo i already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and i will have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights
great device responsive and helpful
works good ni issues
this device does not interact with my home filled with apple devices  how disappointing
no different than apple to play a specific list of music you must have an amazon of spotify plus prime etc account  so you must pay to play your music  3 stars for that reason  everything else is 👍🏻 
plays great
love my spot it now acts as my new alarm
awesome item that i had to buy two
i love my fire stick thank you so much
a great product for the price works well
this is a great tool toy room filling music very convenient to use just fun to have why only 4 stars supposed to work with logitech harmony remote nope supposed to work with denon av receivers nope this may not be amazon't fault but advertised skills should actually work we also have the echo show and the ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door
love it
so far it has worked well not always intuitive as to how to link different devices or skills but getting the hang of it
i have the echo but got 2 show 1 for my daughter absolutely love it especially for the video chat
nice
works great and it is so easy to use that my 4 year old can navigate it
good
i love it bought one for my daughter and one for myself
great sound for the size and the prize and of coursealexa
is amazing i have all 3 and i love this
works perfectly alexa turns on and off my lights my tv roomba
easy set up very user friendly
works much easier than our 3 year old one better internet resemption
a great investment alexa has helped me out and made me laugh
waste of money over the echo generation 2  you do not really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on facetime or skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do i have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution  i have also had problems with this device shutting down and i have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices  price difference is just not worth it
great product so many features
the speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly
we love our echo plus we like listening to musicthe sound is great all the features are nice i do wish it was wireless so we could listen to music outside
i love the echo spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom
we are thoroughly enjoying our amazon echo installation was easy using the alexa app i purchased 2 kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights installation again was easy using the kasa app they sinqued right up with the echo we are enjoying playing music with the echo and the sound quality is awesome we have added a kasa smart bulb for our kitchen setup was seamless we are looking forward to adding more automation to our home
i purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she didshe enjoys all the little and big things it can doalexa play this song what time is it and where and how to cook this and that
not connected to my phone playlist 
simple set up  music everywhere
plenty of options to choose from
i like that it is smaller but it has never understood commands as easily as our first gen original echo did
it was much smaller than i was expecting for the cost
great item for knowledge directions musiclaughter and more
it is like siri in fact siri answers more accurately then alexa  i do not see a real need for it in my household though it was a good bargain on prime day deals
 
perfect  fast shipment and packaging  worked as intended
i do not like how i cannot load my hulu account it is also very slow i know it is not my internet connection because i have an xbox one that works just fine but my fire tv stick takes forever to load anything
it worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound it is perfect for my classroom
i am really enjoying this product love the flash briefing the timers the weather reports and more
so far so good works great
like new
it works great but the reason i am leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available
perfect could not tell the difference from a new one
super easy to hook up and program i use the music feature the most but i love how i can set reminders from my phone and my echo will remind me at the set time it is great for my news updates too
like the little spot  now our guest room is alexa enabled
i love this little gadget replaces my old clock basically love i can listen to music in the morning get weather updates news briefs  let's me know when a amazon order is arriving & has been delivered etc  yes it is a little pricey but purchased it on amazon prime now during prime day and it was delivered same day for $99
stopped working after 2 weeks did not follow commands really fun when it was working
use the product for music and it is great
love it    the best  my experience with refurbished devices is excellent
i really have enjoyed it  changing the directv channels plays iheartradio and pandora  adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights
i love it i use it for everything it is a part of my daily routine
love my alexa echo dot   i have two of them now   one new one refurbished  both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things  i love it as an alarm every morning or whenever  i love it to play music or sounds of the ocean or nature sounds when i am trying to sleep  just love it for so many things
i like almost everything
really like it
some times alexa is a little thick but mostly good
works great bought as a gift for my boyfriend easy & fun to use
works beautifully excellent sound
would be 5 stars if you could turn off the things to try screen  i should have read up on this before buying the spot  amazon please update to enable us to turn this off  it is so extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see things to try
we love having this in our kitchen very convenient to look up recipes listen to the news or watch prime video while i am cooking
initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great
i am just learning about this product but what i know i love 
cool
love it
but not very loud
i love being able to control lights doors and music
works great but speaker is not the good for music will need to get a bluetooth speaker
it is much more difficult to use than the chromecast
my new bff
great product great price on prime day  thanks alexa
easy to setup love all the things she does
i like to use it for listening to podcasts  i like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what is new  the one thing i do not like was getting it to recognize the radio station i wanted to listen to  i finally got it working but had to work through the bugs
i would love this remote if i wasnt spending so much money replacing the batteries its upsetting that i spent money on such a great device all for the batteries not to last
this thing woke me up in the middle of the night saying ready for setup it was already setup should be a simple thing to check  time before asking wife not happy
so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity
use the product for music and it is great
this device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock i love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room its the first nightstand clock i have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep the screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at alloverall a great addition to my smart home its nice to be able to tell alexa to turn on off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone i have a bunch of other alexa devices but this was the first one with a screen
very satisfied with the product
this was a replacement it was really easy to set up i had to reauthorize my smart items to work with the new hub but installation was easy and instructions were clear
we have had the original echo for quite some time and just recently added the show  it was simple to setup and more inviting to use with the visual interface  the echo is being used as the primary interface for my connected home system which is currently only controlling lights and switches  i look forward to expanding on that capability  we also use it for maintaining lists as a music player general information and entertainment  i have not used the show to shuffle through our favorite  photographs but will start that soon
it was smaller than i had anticipated and when i say that i very much mean it however it still works very well quality sound easily programmed easy to work with but alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs
very helpful for playing music setting alarms and talking to you when you are lonely
easy to use and fast setup
works great never had any issues
outstanding i use all the timeworks just like they say
we have so much fun with this  so easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to alexa
this is very user friendly
i love being able to see information that alexa gives  when notifications are turned on it lets you know when your order will be delivered and it also tells you what the order is you can use the echo screen to pull up details of your orders you can use the alexa skill to make calls from uhyour echo
i like the echo show its the best big screen you can watch movies preview from the movie and alexa will answer all your question you name it
it worked for a month or so then it stopped i have tried everything to try and make it work but nothing is working i want a refund
music weather time
i have had previous experience with the echo dot and this just blows all previous expectations out of the waterit is great since it can play videos and music from multiple sources and the speakers are pretty loud
nope still a lot to be improved for most of the things we ask it says hmmmm i dont know that
awesome product
i have been wanting one of these for a while now  bought on prime day and absolutely love it
i like it and it is helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon
awesome product very responsivealexa just needs more content and variety when it comes to music it uses the bing search engine instead of google if only the two could combine it would be a perfect product
funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home  loving it
love the echo i purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs
i would not recommend this to anyone it won't load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it won't run the program all the way thru it tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time try again later  it is not the netflix site cause i can stream it just fine on my computer  its the firestick very disappointing
alarmbed time story universal
awesome device to have in home  full of very useful information  do not have to us e my phone to answer spur of the moment questions
after two weeks i am not sure if i like the ever present alexa to have a screen as well  i bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera and that works  but the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off   instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video  there is something about only audio that made alexa different no i some ways it is a tv that you can talk to
works good for the most part you ask it some questions and she says she does not know i thought she was supposed to know everything
love how i can take it on vacation and use it very easy to set up
so far i like it  i bought it just for some music though and it sounds pretty good
great product
disconnects often
does not know half the things asked can not recognize my sprinkler wifi controller even though product details says it is compatible can not program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router just a handy music player that's if you have amazon music
purchased for my 83 year old mother she loves talking to alexa very responsive can detect its name from all over the room
great addition to our breakfast room kitchen  tunes and information instantly available  slowly learning more features
love it
i own 3 of these  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool  you can customize the screen contents but you cannot turn off there advertising things to try  people will suggest that you can but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable optionmoreover they should increase the size slightly and improve the audio speaker  that would give you a 5 star deviceright now i am debating whether to return all 3 devices  my wife says we should
works very well for amazon and netflix but will not a let all viewing platforms like vudu it also will shut down if hulu is played for more than a couple minutes and yes i have it directly plugged into the wall so low power source is not an issue even checked outlet voltage an issue which is typically the answer you get for that issueover all the quality of the picture is quiet well and is a user friendly platform to use if they would fix those two issues i would have one on every tv in the house but as it sits this will be our only one to bad to because i relay like amazon products and having alexa is always nice
we really love our echo dot we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of
this is my second one i have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home officeit is amazing for a quick look up while i am working i live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointmentsi will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family the gift of organization and information at a voice command away
good speaker for bedroom or office
awesome product i am in the process of having every room in my house set up with automation and the show is now my favorite device
alexa is pretty dumb 
easy setup  love it
perfect for a home office
second one for my house this is greati am not tech oriented and all i have to do is hold down a button and talk now i am watching tv too much lol
we love the show  it loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an show issue or our internet issue  but overall we use it for many applications
up dated news
love it
i love all that you can do with the echo spot
started here with amazon productsand i regret nothing is been absolutely great journey and my products continue to improve my day to day life
the speaker could be better
our family really loves this new echo
very disappointed  alexa does not hear me and does not respond to my requests
love it added it to an upstairs bedroom
the outlet does not work with it was disappointed in that
easy set up
clear music
have not used it enough
so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app
mainly use it for the music but i am learning more all the time  really nothing bad to say about it
i love this item and being able to hear any kind of music  i enjoyed it so much that i ordered another
enjoyed entire echo experience
love it super fun easy to use my three year old even gets involved
very easy to install voice control is great
it does not play you tube videos
the sound is amazing and many collections of all music
good sound works well
this is great for music video calling kitchen timers and probably a bunch more the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever floating things to try on the home screen this is purely an aesthetic complaint but hopefully soon amazon allows the option to shut it off
i love my echo show  and now i have this in my bedroom and it is wonderful music info sleeping sounds
wonderful product  love alexia
new to alexa like this spot a lot
husband loves it
love being able to see as well as hear things  sound is better too
i like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the google only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker easy to use
easy to setup  sometimes alexis does not work the greatest the connection fire stick and wifi is way bettter than netflix 
works great love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices
i do wish the dot could connect to the fire stick but both products still worked flawlessly
just like it is big sister the echo only smaller with slightly less audio fidelity but much lower price on amazon prime day used in another room to add alexa to an additional room
awesomeunderstands my kids
works exactly how you would expect right out of the box i love being able to not only hear but now see what i need on this device i loved my regular echo but the show is just so much better  it works wonderfully for music especially paired with the amazon music account and is perfect with my ring doorbell love it
daughter wanted a white boombox nothing good out for 11 yr old  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white bt good speaker  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet
love it
easy to set up
returned from repair with no repair done it has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itselfi sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed  the site gives no option to complain from the pagei have a echo spot which works perfectly in the same position
this is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better thank you
i really love my dots so awesome how it is connects all my rooms but like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume which i am sure if i connected it to speaker or another device it would be great but as a stand alone the volume is just ok definitely not like my tall echo and the dots do not pick up voice as good as my tall echostill totally love them and would recommend 100%
very happy
not perfect but very good a few times alexa picked up something from tv and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things if you call something light in the app you need to say light not lights echo plus has no problems as a smart hub but i could use better user directions well worth owning and a good step to making my home smart
works well but the speaker is not so grand getting another speaker to drop this into in the future i would have just gone with the full size echo
i like the list ability and the music i can play  i do not like that i can not create a playlist without using the app and even then alexa will not play my songs i have to do it through my tablet or phone  i also do not like that alex can not print again it has to be done through the app
it do not show nothing
bought for my wife she loves it
very responsive great sound quality for its size
works well and was easy to set up
i received the echo in perfect condition the device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues alexa is a great addition to our family
great fun getting to know all the functions of this product  wow    family fun and homework help  talking with other grandchildrenwho also have an echo is a huge bonus  can not wait to learn more and more and more
we got this as a wedding gift and have not discovered all of its features yet will update playing music is great though
we got this as a wedding gift and have not discovered all of its features yet will update playing music is great though
love it it is so handy and easy to use got it for my classroom but i many need to just get another one
have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great
i love this device all the functionality of an amazon echo with the added benefit of a video screen it looks great on my nightstand as a clock lots of faces to choose from and displays weather reminders etc i think it can do video calls too but i use facetime for that anyway it is a great shape and does not take up a lot of room i am planning to get another one for my guest room awesome for a great price
i already have an alexa and with amazon find today i could not resist getting an echo also it is the best thing i ever did i use them on each side of the house and could not be happier
enjoying it and still learning all the commands  ran into one frustrating issue  it was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household
sound very nice perfect for the price
works as advertised
does not use apple music  it is worthless to me without it  sound quality on it is also poor
makes turning on and off things in the house so simple great for little updates as well like checking the weather and such
garbageeven trying to watch amazon prime video this piece of garbage looses internet connection half way thru a show the cheapest roku works 100 time better do not waste your time or money on this piece of garbage
works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability
i just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc the system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming sirius
i like being able to tell alexia the music i want to hear but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if i am not very specific about the title
this thing is great if you have internet and amazon prime
works great video call function nice when communicating through drop in
easy setup using the app which was also easy to install on my phone  the sound quality while for listening to music on pandora is wonderful
almost as good as my bose love the whole house music
more than i expected i use it for timers alarms shopping lists calendar events news weather and so much more
 
the sound from this echo 2nd generation is phenomenal  not to mention that i just love alexa  she is very helpful
love to have meditation music i use it as a morning alarm just to mention few in general i love it
overall it works very well some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money
you could not tell this was refurbished works excellent i would highly recommended instead of purchasing new
it is still a great productbut the sound quality does seem worsedo not get me wrong you definitely get used to it within an hour but it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was betterbesides that  it is greatwith the addition of being able to play just over bluetooth with no wifi it is even better
easy to set up and start using works as advertised
bluetooth sound is great videos are crazy it is an amazing device
easy to use
i like to use it for listening to podcasts  i like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what is new  the one thing i do not like was getting it to recognize the radio station i wanted to listen to  i finally got it working but had to work through the bugs
cant seem to get this thing to sink with my wireless not sure if i will be returning it will try one more time
we like the video calling feature we got this so we can be in contact with our elderly parents and it works well
the echo works well i was able to sync it with my other amazon music devices
my son loves his echo dot
my old amazon fire stick kept crashing when using sling tvi bought this one thinking the old one was defectivethis one is doing the same thing when going back into sling it starts up where i left off in the program
love my echo still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun
still learning it
i love how compact it is
it is fun to use i love novelty gadgets and alexa really works well for me
love it added it to an upstairs bedroom
was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review the one challenge with the hub is that phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub basic functionality works with this unit but now i need two apps to set everything how i want it instead of one which has caused some user issues it is woken up a couple times without the trigger word which i find highly unsettling we have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly but it is usually just one or two repeats if that happensthe speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen living room the sleek design is not obtrusive my girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we have had entertaining conversations with it
tons of features and skills and a very good speaker with plenty of bass for music you still need some work on the ai in responding to random questions though my android phone is far better at those with the echo i still get a lot of hmm i am not sure or i do not have an opinion on that
i am addicted to this thing
great product
funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home  loving it
sad joke worthless
i having it in my living room music sounds really good in my living room  i can hear it upstairs
i really like the echo dot it is amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot
i am in love with alexa
the voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier   the government 
great sound for the size and the prize and of coursealexa
i love it
i love it but does not play well with my amazon prime many shortcomings and potential fees
powerful little stick
works great
got one for me and for my son on prime day we love them i want one in every room but that would be excessive
i like the volume up and down on the top so i can turn it down quickly
we are thoroughly enjoying our amazon echo installation was easy using the alexa app i purchased 2 kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights installation again was easy using the kasa app they sinqued right up with the echo we are enjoying playing music with the echo and the sound quality is awesome we have added a kasa smart bulb for our kitchen setup was seamless we are looking forward to adding more automation to our home
love it  it works great  alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day  i am not an expert but i think the sound quality is fine  not perfect but good
enjoying it and still learning all the commands  ran into one frustrating issue  it was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household
eh it is cool and all but also kinda boring i do not really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3 5 is about right i can not connect to my spotify unless it is premium and i am in college and i am not paying or that or amazon music so
does not work with my fairly new smart tv but that's mainly the tv manufacturerslg fault due to not supporting anything older than tvs from this year my smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well speakers sound great and works very well
love all the cool thing i can do
great little thing works better than siri
cool little piece of techwe are still learning some of its functions and possibilities but i can see some potential  even my ‘technically challenged’ wife already figured out how to video call our daughter
great
i loved it it works great
https  wwwamazoncom dp b073sqyxtw ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_18
i was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement   the display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this taskthe display works well for camera viewingit is an attractive device and a decent value at $99
great size for bedside plus it dims at night
i have a friend now
this is my second show  i like them very much  i use mine for music and my arlo security cameras  i can connect and display my outdoor cameras by voice they are exceptionally capable devices  i highly recommend them
the echo is wonderful but i am still learning how to use it music requests are somewhat limited
this is so much fun to play with   i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell alexa to turn it of   alexa learns from the questions i ask she will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain if i wake up in the middle of the night i do not have to turn on a light i just ask alexa what time is it when i want the current weather she tells me ask her what going on in the city she knows call a friend she will dial  i have not used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts
i love alexa but the sound on the dot is not the best i own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen living room and got this for my bedroom but there’s a significant difference in sound the dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it is coming off a cheap portable speaker i was really disappointed i returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also
well what can you say  love it  love it  love it  enough said
works like a charm fast delivery and no problems
i love this little spot more than i thought i would the sound is great for such a little thingmy music plays nice and loud and clear the video is terrifici was watching some prime shows just for the heck of it and i was really impressed immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthdayonly thing that kept me from giving it 5 starsi really wish it was cordless i love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain and it won’t connect to my bluetooth speaker while playing amazon prime music for some reason which is a drag when i want to hear it in the dining room during dinner of course if it was cordless i could just bring it with meotherwise i absolutely love it and will probably buy another one
bought this a few weeks ago    everything about this product is excellent  do not forget to buy a charger when ordering it is a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard
small speaker tin sound great with good bluetooth speaker
works like any other one
unit came with the wrong plug will have to send back to amazon
this one's going in the kitchen for timer music duty
i am really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device  the bass sounds almost like it is coming from a bigger speaker so props to amazon
good hearing range and sound quality it was a bit complicated to set up and she does not quite understand me a lot even when i am speaking slowly and clearly but i love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system
all the new amazon products i have are great everything i bought refurbished is complete garbage i will never purchase amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction
i love alexa
the fire tv stick was easy to set up and use only downfall is subscriptions are needed to view premium content
i bought this after visiting a friend who had one and it is great  i understand the frustration of not having youtube though  still good to have love seeing the words to songs and if you have the ring doorbell you never have to get up from your chairlaziness at it is best  lol  all in all  a great product with good speakers
the voice recognition is amazing perfect companion for the bedroom
this echo spot is great i love it
it was supposed to come with a free hue lightbulb on amazon prime day  no light bulb arrived  false advertising
great item  i am so glad i made the purchase and on prime day
great sound and easy to set up
i have 2 of them the one i have to reset it at least once a week or so some times twice
works great upgraded from echo dot to full size echo could not be happier
works well not thrilled that most of the apps have to be paid for seprately
love it
bought this for my son and it did not work he had to return it
the firestick we were sent does not work at all  voice remote won’t even turn on we did all the troubleshooting steps did not work contacted amazon they sent us a new one   with no remote no way to control it we gave up and got a roku which works great
best thing i have invested in in a while thank you so much happy happy happy happy
love the product but dislike that i can not sync up my apple music for alexa to play
 
this device does not interact with my home filled with apple devices  how disappointing
i love everything
we are very pleased with this item the display is clean and crisp and easy to read we enjoy trying the suggested things to try asking alexa we use the timer feature quite a bit and have added our calendars and contacts we are still exploring the many skills available
love it  now if i can only find the correct smart linksplug to connect this too
i am amazed at how many movies tv shows and more is available i am planning to drop cable service soon and am very happy to know i will have lots of viewing pleasure with the fire stick and not pay the outrageous cable bills
wish volume was capable of going louder
i like my uncle but sometime it goes a little haywire
i purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she didshe enjoys all the little and big things it can doalexa play this song what time is it and where and how to cook this and that
we love the echo spot i use it on my nightstand for alarm clock and play iheartradio radio while getting dressed
great product but returning for new alexa dot  refurbished is already giving me problems with connection
the problem i have with this item could just be my inexperience i ordered the wrong thing but then decided i would set it up and use alexa i was trying to replace a small bluetooth speaker in my bedroom thought i could learn as i go i downloaded the app but never could get the echo to sync with my iphone i have decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended
the echoplus is a great extension for the echo dots in our home i am a little disappointed that alexa is not as good at information requests as google but as a start on home automation she is very impressive
the screen response time is way better than i expected sound quality is good too also it is not so bright that i have to turn off the screen but it is an option  i have a dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds
the echo dot 2nd generation smart speaker is very compound in size however it  projects very good sound it also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound i also like it size because it is not awkward and it does not take up a lot of space it works great with the alexa app i also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing
it won’t receive calls and it is really hard to call someone who has another echo
works and sounds great my house is barely 1100sf and i have this sitting on my kitchen counter i can hear it and speak to it from any room lots of functionality still to discover
brought to replace one that i moved and does not have the same range as my previous non refurbished unit it would seldom be able to find the wi fi and could not connect got tired of hearing the message trouble connectingcheck the alexa app and just unplugged it i went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times it is just not as strong
 
love these guys they work so great
i set her up to play through our home theater system so fat we are just using her for weather forecasts cooking timers and we really enjoy the music
i basically use it to play music  and tell me the newsits sometimes hard to communicate with it if i dont say the command correctly but i realize its learning my style of speaking and will do some commands even though i dont say them exactly as i should
love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps
it is not as good as siri but it still has some positives it is great at playing music and setting alarms i personally felt that i paid too much for this product as it was nearly half off on prime day literally the day after i purchased it so i am pretty disappointed i might still return it and get my money back 
great sound and easy to set up purchased the echo plus because it had a built in hub and would make it easier to connect to devices i am hooked on alexa
like having the music where ever i am
phenomenal
love i still have not figured out all the best things we can do with it
have had an larger echo for some time and love it bought this one for another portion of the house since we have several wifi home devices and we wanted to voice control them from all over the house
purchased for grandson
works great
i would love this but there is no way to stop the screen from constantly scrolling through things to try if amazon would make this a setting i would change my review to 5 stars
working good so far
the setup of this device was simple and effective  i am very pleased to see all of the additional skills and add on abilities of alexa  this is great for my mobility issues  i now have the ability to have my shopping and comfort needs met without depending on friends and family
i had an alexia built into my thermostat that just did not work very well i had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it i decided to try the echo dot since it was on prime day i have not been disappointed it hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem i really like that i can bluetooth connect to my bose speaker for quality sound
this is the best alexa enabled device you can get it is so versatile and useful it sound way better than the dot but not as good as the regular echo the screen makes all the difference in the world
what a wonderful little alexa enabled gadget at like the analog clock face the best
hands free voice commands and interactions with smart devices around the house makes having an echo plus one of the best purchases i have made
this device works perfectly and was a good price  we love alexa and are having great fun with her  the music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report  i did not think i would enjoy having ai in the house but it is fun educational and entertaining even for people who aren’t tech savvy
it seems to work well  unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because as many have mentioned it does not work with google or youtube any more  this problem is caused by google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these  this even effected my smart tv  anyhow we purchased a few of these to communicate with our children and grandchildren so we will see what happens when we hand them out
i love my echo dot looks brand new and works perfect very satisfied
i use the product as an alarm clock i love being able to set my schedule for the week and not worry about it when images are shown they are cut off little because its trying to fit it into a circle
great item  i am so glad i made the purchase and on prime day
it is s great tool helping with information
works great love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices
works great
as an echo its great good sound quality and functionality as a smart home hub it sucks no automation no geo fencing no music syncing for hue no z wave all it does is turn things on with your voice ended up buying a smartthing hub and transferring everything over
we regret waiting so long to purchase this item we are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality
very useful
i bought this on prime day and saved lotsi have 3 large blue tooth speakers in my house that i used for years the echo plus was louder than all 3 combined at the same time very impressed with the clarity and volumeyou will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio that’s just a sad fact it will play pandora and spotify but it is limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptiondoes not stream youtube music or youtube audioapple users will be disappointed to see that it is not as convenient as an apple deviceoverall i still loved the device but i will be getting the dot which has an audio out jack as does the echo plus and just connect to external speakers
no different than apple to play a specific list of music you must have an amazon of spotify plus prime etc account  so you must pay to play your music  3 stars for that reason  everything else is 👍🏻 
so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app
terrific sound for a small device and nice form factor for the nightstand i like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking alexa not using video much but it would be nice if the device had a square rectangular screen
i got a second unit for the bedroom i was expecting the sounds to be improved but i didnt really see a difference at all  overall not a big improvement over the 1st generation
ease of set up i will have fun sitting up other features as well as making my house a smart home
love this thing best toy i have bought myself in awhile so far i have a smart plug connected running my ac  and the wifi light bulbs  baseball scores weather are  cool but the music is the best feature
i love it  easy set up as well
do not waste your money  i own an echo gen 1 and echo gen 2 and a dot they all do a far better job of voice recognition that the echo show  in fact it is so bad that it is virtually useless  also the speaker is incredibly bass heavyso much so that it is hard to understand voices  i have worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble but it still sounds awful  finally the screen just does not add much  i can not see if from across the room it rarely activates in any meaningful way and when it does not it is more of a distraction than a helpusing facetime is so much more practicalthan using the show i am surprised amazon did not make this a little more useful than it is  perhaps in the future but for now it is a waste of time and money
purchased as a more personal contact vehicle for engaging with long distance grandchildren works perfectly in every regard resolution and sound both better than expected highly recommend
very easy to use makes finding shows and movies a snap
no problems works as expected could have a better speaker
amazing product still learnimg all the things it can do
i love it now able to talk to my grandson with ease and the picture quality is great
love the fire stick and the amazon customer service
this is very hard to review because i am part of the  problemi am 75 and got it so my dog would have distracting noise when i am not homei am computer literate itunes literate amazon literate as well as countless other programs but am apparently a dunce when it comes to talking to alexa  i think i heard her sigh in exasperationi tried to create a playlist of songs i like only to have it ignored  i am learning workarounds but they are mediocre at bestand as yet do not include a personal playlisti have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic alexa than am iso far i like what i have been able to use but i would like it a lot more if i could configure it to my needs rather than accepting the amazon alexa defaultkaren
perfect
i really like this product and the fact that i can get apps that i am unable to get on my smart tv
i enjoy it still discovering new uses
i love the simple set up i love the fact that it has all the answers to most of the questions that i have i bought one for everybody in my family so we can all be like the jetsons
this unit add much pleasure to our echo plus  we now can have music and information through our home or just in one room
we gave the echo spot as a gift to my mother in law  she loves it  she can play music of all genres  easy for her to use
very cool
bought this a few weeks ago    everything about this product is excellent  do not forget to buy a charger when ordering it is a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard
such a handy item to have on my night stand she reads to me at night and gets me all set for the day in the morning with my calendar and weather views
this is the best of my echo devices and i own a spot a dot and echo
i love love it 
great device  seems to work better than the 1st generation
great product   understands my accent
great product
sounds great have not used the hub yet
we love using it for bedtime reading on audible it is very kid friendly and i can see liking it in the kitchen while i am cooking since it is small and unobtrusive we like it better than our echo dot
i love it
no problems works as expected could have a better speaker
i like the weather options but alexa search compacity needs improvement she aint no google alexa gets our requests probably around 20% of the time currently alexa does not do youtube either this is a huge drawback and why the echo show dropped in price  international radio via tune in is awesome but again her search engine its like pulling teeth to get to anything
 
not impressed
i like it alot i connected it so i can play my pandora and i asked about the weather & time every morning i got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because i can have my music play unlimited on this i am going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once i get more comfortable with it definitely worth the money
video calls to mom
bought for my older grandparent to help with reminders would recommend to anyone with someone in their life with dementia or memory loss helps my grandmother remember to take medications and do daily task she loves it because she can listen to music and ask questions
the speaker sounds really good
love my echo love playing music in my room
i have had for only a week so i am still learning all that alexa can do  it is a learning process  i love the music i can call up any time  i listen to podcasts and radio stations  i have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists which i love  i do not have to search for paper and pencil  getting time and temperature are great do not have to wait for weather reports  the sound is good  i am not fussy about woofers tweeters base  etc  the echo is fine for me  this afternoon i am going to try dropping inon my son when he gets home  going to surprise him
love it and alexa i am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient
while i loved alexathis is a whole new level love it fun to watch movie trailers weather is so much more complete when you listen to musicthe lyrics appear still discovering all echo show can do highly recommend takes alexa to a completely new world
perfect for a home office
i liked the original echo this is the same but shorter and with greater fabric color choices i miss the volume ring on top now it is just the plus minus buttons not a big deal but the ring w as comforting  other than that well i do like the use of a standard usb charger  port instead of the previous round pin other than that i guess it sounds the same seems to work the same still answers to alexa echo computer so what is not to like 
nice works great
glad i upgraded my aka
love it thanks amazon you guys rock
the best part about owning this is that my mother who is anti technology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well well done
extremely low in volume
 
can not change voice of echo
incredible piece of technologyi have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter the mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good i connected the echo via bluetooth to my sony soundbar on my tv but find the echo placement and 360 sound more appealing it is no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass the sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building the knob on the top works great for adjusting volume this is my first echo device and i would imagine having to press volume buttons on the echo 2 a large inconvenience and not as precise for that alone i would recommend this over the regular echo 2nd generationthe piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it the rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter   my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it overthis order came with a free philips hue bulb which i installed along with an extra one i bought i put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp turned on the light and all i had to do was say alexa connect my devices the default names for each bulb was assigned as first light and second light so i can have a dimmer floor lamp if i just turned on off one of the lights by saying alexa turn off the second light in the alexa app i created a 'group' with first light and second light and named the group the light so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining i just say alexa turn on the lighti was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the echo plus with its built in hub i thought i would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb i was surprised by that awesomeyou will feel like tony stark on this device i added quite a few skills like 'thunderstorm sounds' and 'quote of the day'  alexa always loads them up quickly adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on amazon music is also a great featurei can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownershipi was lucky to buy this for $100 on prime day but i think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the echo 2 is only $100 in my opinion you will be paying a premium for the echo plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you1 taller and 360 sound unit2 volume knob on top that you spin i think this is a huge benefit over buttons3 built in hub for hue bulbs after researching more there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups for me and my floor lamp it is just perfecti highly recommend it and will buy an echo dot for my bedroom now
primarily for music in our bedroom  i wish the speaker had better fidelity
my favorite echo a more than adequate replacement for a clock radio
we went to a best buy with the intention of buying alexa products instead were talked into the google home products bought the google home and the home mini has trouble from the start setting them up and they could not understand my husband scottish accent after days of the oops something went wrong command we returned them and bought the amazon echo show and the echo plus so easy to set up it connected immediately to my amazon account and was way easier to navigate they both understand commands from my husband on the first try and have yet to give an error message we have loved these two products and should have gone with what we intended in the first place you won’t regret your purchase
i have 3 dots and 2 original and this new one works perfectly  will buy all my future dots reconditioned
easy setup using the app which was also easy to install on my phone  the sound quality while for listening to music on pandora is wonderful
love it as i do all of my echos
this is my second firestick i a very pleased with the ease of use
fun to use good sound quality
we have not used it much yet  we like what we have used my husband loves it
love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps
the echo part works fine  the hue hub is a disaster  it worked for a few months and then nothing  i spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair  i am now trying to reconnect my lights  what a pain  i am having to reset each light bulb  it can take up to 5 times to get it to reset  i have spent hours on this  i will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful  stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps
great for mom its inside an owlhead in her jacuzzi
its work perfect an i must introduce the rest of the device to complete the functions
versatile use can watch movies or news  able to use as remote for vehicle  or use as a communication hub for the home  great produc
my new best friend 
echo show is perfect for staging in the kitchen so recipes are right there no need to print them wonderful device acoustical sounds are not as powerful as our tall cylindercal echo but we have that covered in the adjacent family room
works fine
i love it
this echo is just as great as my others even though it is smaller
it is smaller than the original looks nicer too
i have had alexa since the beginning  i accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation  i decided i could not be without an echo  setup was easy and had it working within minutes
the commands alexa requires are too specific  i find google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what i am asking for
luv it  it is a great product
works great bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house
prime day pricing was good but the show is very limited  no video services available except amazon video  no netflix or youtube  alexa is very limited also not nearly as useful as google
great addition to my echo plus
it was a gift
i need to get some better controls for custom displays and the ability to make my own clock but that's asking a lot in general great device glad i got it
i purchased this for my daughter and we all love this its amazing we love the games
i used to use my laptop for anything show watching including netflix but i am glad i bought this this is super easy to set up and has everything you need with quick and easy access definitely worth the buy
good quality great sound quality
love it
it works perfect
bought this for my bedroom and the show for my living room love them both the spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design shows lyrics photos  etc i paired it with a smart plug for the bedroom lamps alexa turn off lights love it
i love it  i especially love that it is so small and does so much  got rid of my old cd alarm clock radio  much more room on nightstand
still learning how to use it but like it so far we played music from youtube and a couple movies on it no complaints
very excited to see what it can do
how did i live this long without the echo  you get to enjoy any music style  just my asking alexa  going to up greade to the wireless  love the echo  love you too alexa 
i use the echo dot several different ways in my home i use it downstairs to control lighting i also take it out on my deck to stream music to a bluetooth speaker it works great for what i need
it is great for music a little hard to figure out how it works
pleased with the echo it is loud and can hear my voice and understand much better than previous versions
we love the size of the 2nd generation echo still needs a little improvement on sound
i love all of the things that it can do i can play with it and learn from it
love it small with good sound
the echo spot is really great i just got it and is easy to set up i do have one problem when the advertise it they show a screen with the time weather and your town sadly there is no way to make this the home screen the home screen is just the time😔 i spoke to support and the wonderful lady tried and researched for 45 minutes to no avail i am disappointed because i wanted that screen all the time not just during an occasional screen rotate i am hoping they will do something about this other than that it is great
like
works great i love it grand daughter digs the watching of cartoons on it lol
still leaning about it the price was right
echo show is said to work with certain apps butnot cozi state works with echo show but the cozi family’s does not very well amazon needs to go back to drawing board it would be such a needed piece of technology but it lacks the essential please fix cost of the echo show was  marvelous  got echo show to take on shopping list but that is all so far adding items to list has long lag and it not my router being slow my provider speed is gb speed not a problem but before new items is updated on cozi is very slow help is needed to get it updated to a1 working conditioning
i love my echo plus i have not one bad thing to say it controller music when i need it too with a great sounding 360 speaker i also bought a 4k fire tv and it can open amazon prime video or netflix at any moment the included hue lighting makes this product even better i found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room the addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer alexa will controll it all as soon as you say hey alexa and if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device this is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort
these things are great
love it
love my echo show great sound and picture does a great job thing in my entire echo collection
bought this for my daughter when she turned 9  she loves it  i especially like the calling feature since she does not have a cell phone  she loves playing music and dancing and with amazon music she can play all her favorite songs  sometimes over and over and over again lol
so i am not sure how i feel about the echo dot it is so many things that i need to get used to you have to ask her the right questions or she won't understand you
it does what it is suppose to do great product
i was suppose to get the free lightbulb with purchase it did not come with echo upon reading more carefully it says to click a box to receive free bulb 😳 of course i want the free bulb who wouldn’t just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many  free  bulbs away disappointed  i have yet to set up my echo our first purchase on any alexia device debating if we want to keep it it did come quickly with my prime membership
totally gets out sense of humour
alexa wakes me up everyday for work to whatever station on iheart radio or spotify i want plus when i do get smart home devices she’ll be even more useful to me she’s really helpful with answering random questions the small screen sucks for video as it is small and round but it is nice to have something to show time and pictures
easy to set up can control kasa smart plugs no problem  even the kids have figured stuff out that i would not have asked alexa like telling jokes and singing the alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam
its got to be one of the coolest things
works awesome
the best
the sound quality is really quite good i also have a dot which is bluetooth linked to a grace digital amplifier which is driving a couple of floor standing snell speakers obvious the floor standing speakers are better than this but not by much my only complaint is that you can not customize alexa hot words now that i have multiple alexa devices there needs to be a way to direct an alexa command to a particular device i would like to be able to talk to a device by name
still needs some work on commands sound is equal in the regular echo so if you do not need a smart hub get a regular echo the sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but i mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear
great product
sound quality is less than a dot microphones do not pick me up as well as the other models i have echo and dots  picture quality is good
easy to set up and use too bad it has to be plugged in would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged
great deal on prime day
pretty cool device still have a lot to learn but i am changing channels on my fios and getting info needed the speaker is great for what i needed it for which mainly is music
no it is broke and i can not get help fixing or replacing it
 
i liked it was linked to prime
it is ok the speaker is pretty terrible google home is a better product
this is my second echo and i love how it helps me in the kitchen i can set timers listen to the news prepare grocery lists and get great music
having so much fun with alexa love being able to listen to music when i am across the room or busy doing something else
love these  great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering  or listen to cnn live with serius sm
son loves it
i love it
i am still learning how to use it  i figured out it can read my kindle books to me which is a real bonus
very impressed with look clarity of sound and color
refurbished is the way to go my echo works just like new
alexa is great only she will laugh or add random comments in conversations last night i was asking a sibling why they are using alexa upstairs versus the one downstairs then the echo dot downstairs starting singing oh technology oh technology kind of weird but it seems to have a mind of its own
i love the echo spot
this is our first alexa we love it
i love the fact that i can unplug it and take it to my basement when i want do laundry
works amazingly i bought it for my daughter and she loves it
easy to use easy to set up
got this for my 2nd echo in the house i already have the regular echo  the echo dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable wishing i would have just gone with another regular echo solely based on sound
i love my echo spot that my daughter and son in law got me for my birthday alexa wakes me each morning and plays music when i ask
excellent device  works great having no problems or concerns
great easy to set upa little difficult to navigate and the instructions are non existent
i am not sure why or how amazonia asking me about this purchase i got it as a gift from my kids for mother’s day  it was not bought from my account lil bit creepy 😑 i have not really had much use for it as no one calls they text so that part meh the other things it does are no different than the other alexa products
i like the echo plus it is wonderful the least thing i do not like is it does not turn off every
i was hesitant to buy the echo because i have the echo dot and it seems good enough the echo is the same except the sound quality which i really did not feel i needed however i am so glad i got it what a difference the sound really is far superior to the echo dot now i can listen to the greatest showman with a little more power
works as advertised speak clearly and research the commands also get the wall holder it keeps it out of the way set up is a breeze just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone for some reason it made set up easierthough it could be psychological haha
we are still in the discovery phase but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed
works great
for now i love everything so cool with my music and flash briefings 5 star echo
using as a hub and music
works wonderfully
this product just looks adorable in any room and i love it i recently just bought my mom one as a gift on prime day and she can not wait to use it
works great but speaker is not the good for music will need to get a bluetooth speaker
so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity
i bought on prime day and so glad i did it is easy to use and lots of customization options i know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read but i disagree
upgraded from my lilttle echo dot happy with sound
i love it pretty cool
phenomenal
easy to use  amazing
easy to set up plug it in then make some selections for your preferences such as language temp c or f etc i am getting more familiar with it and will be adding my calendar and appointments
love it  this time it is a gift  for friend
love it
expensive but it is a slightly better sound than my original echo
i am so disappointed in this product  i tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed  hours with amazon technicians resetting each of them  the app did not connect the echo plus to the internet connection  tried using the application on a phone a tablet and on a chromebook no luck  there are no clean directions on the application  probably sending this back to amazonmark this as not ready for prime time
i love every aspect of the echo plus i wanted it for my office the light was also for my desk lamp
i like the fact that i can get any kind of music from prime that i want on request from alexa i liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your tv etc to the commands from alexa but i really love having the music
i use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information
i love it best gift i got myself
i connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my google home mini can not do  it works well
works fine i just realize i do not need this because i do not use it
easy to set up and to use
 
love it
love it it is like having a second wife
the sound of the speaker is better than the other echo i own
so far alli can say is i love it
easy to set up and connect with smart devices just what i needed
fairly easy to use
 
i like the looks better than the original echo  i moved my old echo to the basement family room nice sound
very good
i really have enjoyed it  changing the directv channels plays iheartradio and pandora  adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights
i bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly if they weren't labeled as refurbished i wouldn't have known
beyond my capabilities to program grandkids lve it
i am impressed with the quality of sound that the echo has it is definitely comparable to my bose mini i only gave 4 stars because i can not use my apple music account
it is constantly buffering to the point where you can not watch anything without interruption i purchased on prime day plus i used rewards to pay for it so in the end i paid next to nothing if i had paid full price for it i might want my money back we stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device i know our internet service is not the issue because we do not have this problem with any other devices that we stream from
just getting use to using the echo used it for shopping lists listening to music and as a timer working great so far
works on great i  use it with my arlo security system
 
coop product many uses including smart devices throughout the home
met every expectation i had
how easy if was to set up
does not work with you tube tv
works as advertised
really cool device that does a ton of stuff fun games like jeopardy we used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges
love this product
very intelligent love the songs 
been debating on getting one but am happy i did still more to explore thanks
i am extremely impressed with this item bought it from the warehouse or outlet with a minor imperfection can not tell it even has one works great did not come in packaging but it was sealed up and had no damage and was not missing anything i like the sound quality i see some knock it it is not a bose but it is more than great for our family easy to use minor learning curve as it learns your voice it integrates seamlessly with my other amazon servicescan not wait to get for my classroom too it is a lot of fun even just as a speaker let alone what i plan to do with it
workreat
the product is attractive and somewhat useful but amazon chose to force users to view their things to try and trending  this greatly depreciates the value of the product  do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from amazon
this is so fun i really enjoy using it i have it hooked up to one of my lights so i just tell alexa when i want that on and off also it connects to my spotify so i just have alexa resume my playlist and we pick off right where we ended i feel like there's even more i can do with this so i am excited to use it more
great device features are awesome the interaction is fantastic home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly my only issue is out of 4 echo shows 2 of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching these are less than 3 months old and already having issuesfirst repairs were sent off and they updated the firmware when i got the device back nothing worked i had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again then 2 weeks later the glitch starts up againi love the show but i am getting really frustrated with the glitching
surprisingly good beefy sound out of this thing i think it might shape up to be one of my favorite echo devices i have nearly all of them  
still getting used to alexa do not have her connected to our tv yet or other things right now use her for music and information which she is great
not much features
great product
 
i love the product  but very disappointed once i  realized i can no longer play youtube videos  i am now past my 30 days return date  i am realizing i now have an expensive alarm clock  i am hoping youtube comes back  i was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during prime day glad i did not
the current demand for this stick was too high for the power coming out of my usb port on the tv had to run the power cable to the supplied usb adapter not a big deal but added another cable showing on my wall mounted tv
exactly what i wanted with speedy shippingthank you so much
love alexa makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time
small footprint  nice clarity
works as advertised very easy to setup still learning what this can do
the entire family loves alexa echo she’s now a part of this family
what a blast  we love echo  just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too
super easy set up and am loving our new echo
love these  great sound easy to connect and use
i already had purchased the echo and a couple of dots and hesitated to purchase this until the price dropped  i am very glad i did  the versatility of the video screen is outstanding  no regrets
worked as it should still need to figure out how to link to other devices though only set up sonos which was pretty easy not the products fault just have not had time to figure it out
i was contacted by people in india were they suppose to charge me $7900 it was very hard to understand their instructions they did have control of my computer and network i also bought a cloud cam but do not know how to make it work with alexa
love this thing easy to setup and  looking forward to adding more smart devices to my home
very fun to use and having morning briefing
the echo spot is compact nice sound and camera quality makes it great to video chat with the family when i am travelling for work ease of use that the youngest member 10 years has no problem talking to mama on the video chat and understands the important of digital security
love it great product
when we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra $30so we thought why not well i am so glad we did we are really enjoying our echo spot it reads stories to our girls plays music gives us the news and so much more  it is so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy
it does everything the echo does and more although i have not and probably won't use the video functions i had hoped that the display would be allow for more customization it does not and is very limited i would like the clock and weather to display in large text all of the time it only displays in very small text it also always has a line that says tell alexa to do this or that tips at the bottom of the screen i would like to see that go away but it won't sound quality is good not as good as the big echo but good enough i bought it on sale and think i got value for what i paid i would have been disappointment had i of paid full price
never had any issue with buying use electronics as long as i get the good or like new just read the comment to see why it is used
 
purchased to use on the road in my semi does not work in that application
 
love it  this time it is a gift  for friend
i am not easily impressed with electronic goodies butomg this is by far the coolest thing i have ever had  it does everything short of clean your house which when i asked alexa to clean my house was told she did not have hands but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning  from reading books to my five year old to video chat to silly selfies music that automatically goes to my bose bluetooth speaker setting timers alarms changing my thermostat on voice command tells me the weather sends hubby a grocery pick up list and i am sure million more thingsbuy ityou u will not regret it
ok
love it bought for my granddaughter who is 3 for her to play music and ask questions she is entertained for hours good buy in my honest opinion
love the echo show great in  kitchen  for recipes
love it
love all my echo products i like the video phone feature on this can check in on our cat when on vacation
i have used roku & mi tv box this fire tv stick is very similar easy to use
love my echo still learning all the things it will do wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package but found a great one on u tube
easy to set up can control kasa smart plugs no problem  even the kids have figured stuff out that i would not have asked alexa like telling jokes and singing the alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam
i live alone this is the best companion
my new best friend i am a little behind the times i have never had anything like this another alexa or google home so to me this is a super amazing useful tool i use it to play sleep sounds to sleep i use it for my amazon audible books set alarms reminders receive notifications play games with her have her tell me a short story lol it is pretty fun i know some people complained about the speaker i am not sure why i am sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough but i rent a room and in my bedroom it is perfect i do not have any problems with the speaker love everything about it
i love it it plays my sleep sounds immediately when i ask
i love to watch my wife argue with alexa  i woke up one night listening to alexa talking to my cell phone 
during prime day this 2nd gen echo was on sale so i could not resist this was the beginning to my smart home set up and i could not be happier to say that alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my smart devices thanks to her i can control my lights smart plugs tv etc i had no trouble connecting the echo to my wifi and my phone the app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills routines smart devices timers and so much more sound quality is good enough for me since i am not an audiophile alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume design is great and modern it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale overall this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities if you have not yet be sure to add alexa to your home
i like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality i expected
amazing paroduct
gave as a gift   they loved it
i am amazed
i loved everything
very puny sound but works great
 
love the echo i purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs
very amazing product great sound quality
it is pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but does not understand my commands some of the time
i like the compact structure of the dot the sound is a little too low
i have had pure fun with my echo  weather jokes news briefing and music but still so much more to use it for  a lot of fun for the money
took me awhile to get it connected i am not electronically savy but now that it is i love it
 
i bought two  one for me and one for my daughter who lives in another state  we love it
this was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad he loves it ask alexa anything she has the answer plus it is good for homework so i purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when i am getting ready for work i listen to music at 4am and the base it is metro booming replacement for my clock radio plus i have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock
technology in such a small device the price was good too the sound is amazing a must have feature for any home
great product wakes me up every morning on time
alexa is amazing great speaker
great product and easy to use
like google better
disappointed that this device is not able to access youtube as of dec 2017 i wasn’t aware of that when i purchased it i have had problems with my device the voice stops working throughout the day i can see it trying to respond to me because the window it opens contains the info i asked about but it is like the device gets stuck in the process it stops working and the blue bar just flashes i keep having to unplug and restart the device once i do that it starts working again so irritating this device could really be a great device if google and amazon would act like grownups
the product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has  and even that one has bluetooth and does not need to be plugged in the only good thing about this is that you can speak to it
it has a screen microphones speaker and alexa lives inside  yup it is an echo show  expectations met
it f sucks
home entertainment
clear music
great product
this is my first alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation
i love all of the things that it can do i can play with it and learn from it
i was hesitant to buy the echo because i have the echo dot and it seems good enough the echo is the same except the sound quality which i really did not feel i needed however i am so glad i got it what a difference the sound really is far superior to the echo dot now i can listen to the greatest showman with a little more power
love love love
very good quality
easy to set up and use too bad it has to be plugged in would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged
we have so much fun with this  so easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to alexa
great just like new
we have six of these throughout our home and they are great  there are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening  there should be more options to change the name of the engagement command alexa or computer are a little annoying  more colors then black and white would also be a good thing
just as good as the new one i bought but $1000 less
at a volume setting of half or less the speaker sounds like there is something rattling crackling or vibrating in it  i would understand if the volume was set higher  all speakers get distorted when over driven  but this does not sound like this is an over driven case sounds like more of a rattle crackle  possibly because the bass is too high  learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics other than volume  i will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem
best bedside clock and assistant i have ever had
i feel that the voice feature is useless lots of channels to stream though
 
i love this thing at first i thought it wouldn’t stay on the clock and that i would have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and it is very comfortable for the eyes easy set up love it
 
absolutely love my echo show  it is awesome and works great with my ring video spotlight cams  music on demand and so many more features that i have yet to explore
poor quality gave it away
alexa helps with more than just lights or music it helps out when your kids think they know everything and you know nothing  lol  sweet  love it  so much so i purchased 2 alexa has been a great purchase for my uncle whom lives by himself when i got it he wasnt so keen on it but now its his best friend he tells her goodmorning and she will say it back along with a description on something that is happening today or something special that happened years ago on that day as well as sang him happy birthday  lolol  he now has educated him self on things he never knew and laughs at the things she may say when he waits to see he response to something hes asked  love it and to think i was going to hate it
 
great product at a great price
i am quite disappointed by this productthere clearly is a bug half of the time i ask for a newsflash two second after it starts the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes same goes when i ask to play the radio also many times it get confused when i ask to switch of the lightsas other items are also named the same which is not true clearly no ai or natural language very 'beta' stage still for me not impressed
easily configured hub capabilities  excellent sound quality for the size of the unit
love echo everywhere i go in my house she's always reminding me playing music or talking to me  love her
 
second dot work great for refurbishedthought it was new
works perfectly
great deal great product
i like the echo but not sure about the dot  i use it a lot for music and audio booksthe sound quality of this smaller echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model  i have not decided if i will keep it or not
looks great
works better than anticipated this thing is awesome
i am impressed with the sound quality
great product need a bit a adjustment to set up spotify time weather etc in hong kong but works fine now i used it as alarm clock + music in bedroom love it
refurbished but just as good as the new ones that i have bought
we love it  we use it every day and are finding new ways to use it the longer we have it
the speaker is of surprising quality happy with the purchase
easy to set up and use
great sound quality great features great product multi room music is very cool
i love my echo smart speaker  i love the volume and clarity  it was easy to set up  its a wonderful gift for any age
this was an impulse buy but turns out i really enjoy my new dot my grands love requesting songs and playing games i like listening to my audible selection keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new alexa skills fun and practical my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home
review
i wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom  but the font is too small to see from any distance  and apparently you can not change it
echo plus with built in hub   black amazon
i like having more alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting
very intelligent love the songs 
45 out of 5 stars i generally like this product its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music setting timers and making calls reason why i did not rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my echo stops playing music and shows a red ring seems to be a connection issue overall great product
i enjoy this thing its learning
i love everything about the fire stick it is easy to use and alexa makes it quicker to get to tv shows or music
we all just love the tv fire stick and i would buy it again
it isn’t bad for what it is have issues with it actually playing what i want getting it use iheartradio properly by playing the station i want is a challenge but it is not bad for the sale price i paid
does what i expected and more
i like the whole thing so far
sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated zigbee hub  the hub is compatible with the ge link bulbs
bought this to go in my niece's room you can not tell it is refurbished it looks good and works like new
nice product but as intelligent as we thought or had hoped
after we learned to use this we are still learning we are very pleased with echo plus
this product replaces the 1st generation fire stick i had and what an improvement in speed in both showing amazon content but all apps downloaded on product i bought in on prime day for $19  best deal ever 
a++++
just as advertised bought as a gift great price fast shipping
love it  so do the grandkids
this is the 3rd unit i purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus the only reason i purchased this is because it works so well and i wanted it in other rooms as well all my switches work great and i have had not issues i the past i did have some ghost commands when alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but i think some recent ipdates may have resolved this it just keeps improving over time not with call capabilities i work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest best way so far can not wait to see what they come up with next
very easy to set up and very easy to use
we are really enjoying the echo plus it is fun too
home entertainment
i purchased an echo dot for my husband for fathers day  he uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the echo 2nd generation it was a no brainer  best gift ever
love it very easy to set uplove that you can request just about anything on your mind and it works on giving you useful information
the speaker is of surprising quality happy with the purchase
son loves it
 
love it
loved them
it does everything  the big guy does
easy setup alexa needs a lot of training
it plays music that i request
still learning to use these things  they sure are smart  haha  she started reading a book to me yesterday  get one  i like the way it controls the brightness all by itself when lights are turned off at night
love it
works and sounds great
i bought this for my healing room  i play continuous spa like music although alexa knows the type of music needed the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled  i did not know i had to buy speakers too
sound quality is disappointing
initially this echo dot worked very well over time the dot stopped responding to 'alexa' unless you were within one foot of it yelling the other echos echo dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot would not recommend buying refurbished
it works
sound is greatvideo is great now i just need to learn everything it can do where can i see videos youtube listen to music watch the news
very easy to use
i am guilty of not setting this up i had my youngest daughter do it she did not seem to have much trouble figuring it out so i would have to assume it was not very difficult i have not tried to use it  yet but my oldest seems to like it so she ordered one for herself
there's really no dislike for alexa dot i thought cortna was cool but alexa is an awesome application to the family unbelievable device which seems alive a must get
this is pretty cool
good product
outstanding product   easy to use  works great
i love being able to control lights doors and music
the only draw back is it stops every once in awhile in the middle of a song 
love it
un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como el tiempohorainformación de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet
woohoo $20 on prime day done
it is got great sound and bass but it does not work all of the time its still hot or miss when it recognizes things
this thing is way cool  you should get one  if you want to be cool that is
really like it
not good at all
i love it use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from
very nice  i am impressed   wish she had more to say though
fast shipping and works well
use way more often than we used our google home
good but it is pretty low
i bought it to go with my security camera system but it did not perform like i thought it would it does not alert us when someone is at the door also i can not talk to the person at the door through the echo show only through my cell phone
the speakers arent too loud alexa is great though besides that naw
like everything about it the music the trivia games the weather
i used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos
was not sure if i would like this product but after having it for a little while i want one in every room my daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words we have barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and i am looking forward to learning all of its capabilities
love the echo dot
 
i have a friend now
granddaughter loves it
responds easily and like the ability to do at night
amazing paroduct
i have already returned it
i do not know why i held out on getting this for so long
love my dots  easy to use  i have two plus the echo spot  one of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music  amazon iheart radio pandora
love the echo  i love the size material and speaker quality i have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat next is echo dot for bedroom there is a lot more to do with echo that you think traffic weather trivia etc
i am amazed with the alarm i tell alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does  i love the play list if music not sure if i do not keep prime if music will still be available however i did love the fact amazon gave me music free for 3 monthsthey should have given prime free for 3 months as well
had a dot and upgraded to this i like it my only complaint is the very short instructions
i think the dot listens better than spot
this is a very useful device  i use it to turn my lights on and off around the house  it works with all the other alexa devices so i can give a command near any of them and this will process the request  it also handles all the functions that the other devices can do i enjoy it much more than i thought i would
this echo plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life
very satisfied easy setup great product highly recommend
itiswhat it is and than some sounds great too ony thing i dont like the camera being seen by anyone working for amazon  i asked echo show to show me camera and did not know what i was saying but knows how to turn camera on and off but can not dhiw u what’s recording hmm
i purchased an echo dot for my husband for fathers day  he uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the echo 2nd generation it was a no brainer  best gift ever
love this my daughter enjoys telling alexa what to do haha
it offers hours of entertainment and it was very easy to install and activate thumbs up
love the echo and how good the music sounds playing off it alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on spotify she is good with amazon music but is lacking in other major programs
great love it
starting my day
this was my 4th echo device 1st echo show  it seemed to have huge potential and i really wanted to like it but soon found out it is quite limited a bit disappointing but not the end of the world i used it like i use my other screenless echos for a little under 2 month when the screen started flickering mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just a quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement as some people had 2 3 devices replaced only to start flickering again shortly after amazon are not providing any serious answers and this has been going on for quite some time apparentlylong story short i moved it to the hallway and been using it as a very expensive and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights so like the headline suggests meh
just what i expectedalready have 2 other  shows
the volume is very low
easy to set up ready to use in minutes
nice product
very satisfied with the product
i love it
speaker could be better qualty
i do not think the 2nd gen sounds as good as the 1st  but it does have an aux out so you could add an external speaker  but if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot  2nd issue is which isn't unique to this unit but i do not understand why i can not override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a group  i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker  but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker
i had a couple of echo dots previously   bought these _specifically_ for the ring doorbell video   cloud cam display   interface capabilities was not disappointed love the fact that i can ask to see front yard   back yard   front door etcthe video chat with the other rooms is also quite coolbonus alexa show me ant man trailer etci know this can all be done on laptop desktop but it is cool now having an ‘appliance’ that’s always just there and it does not interrupt what i am doing
i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account  i think it should be part of the top line with video music etc  i also think the setup app where i define for example music i like is not well integrated into echo  i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings  i also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names which i can never rememberi like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries
was excited to try this on my new element tv  unfortunately even though my tv is 5 feet away from my router i get maddening disconnections and buffering  thought this little device was supposed to take care of that issue  it did not
supberb sound definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music
only complaint i have is that the sound quality isn't great i mostly use it for commands though and i have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through i have a couple friends that have a dot and do not mind the audio quality but if you're bothered by that kind of thing i would go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers
i am pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of alexa the unit is very responsive and can easily respond even with tv or music playingi did pair two smart  bulbs and they go on off and dim with ease using voice or app fidelity is very good for the sizemy only regret is that i would have liked a silver model or a fabric cover but that is an unimportant issue
i love searching the alexa skill shop on the app useful things like having alexa turn my lights on and off listening to news updates every morning and fun stuff like telling alexa to make the star trek red alert nois or playing song quiz with friends
i like the variety of stuff that the echo show offers
i am having real difficulty working with the echo dot alexi is not very smart 9 out of 10 questions i have asked i get the i am not sure  half the time i am still asking the question and alexi is saying i am not sure the music is great and works well for that all in all so far it is been a very frustrating experience
i liked linking two more rooms in the home
i am finding more and more uses for this all the time it keeps me informed with news and weather i can get a daily bible verse and have it play music new skills are added all the time the future is here
my wife has been using skype for years to talk to her parents daily with constant technical issues  since her father is 88 it is a lot to ask the man to uninstall reinstall reconfigure skype but he does  when i saw these on sale i jumped on them  my wife was resistant to learn a new technology but i told her these just work   like the video phones i saw at the new york world's fair in 1964   54 years agoyesterday it set up quickly and worked fine with no issues  my wife told her co worker today and she went out and bought 3   one for herself and her husband and one for each set of parents  it just works like a telephone   imagine that
i used it to control my smart home devices works great
works great good sound
echo dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it i have unplugged it it feels like it is spying on us
i like it all
i am obsessed with alexa she tells me the weather every morning she can play games we love the guess the song one and the one we have upstairs can turn off our tv downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if alexa will do it for you
i love the echo spot this bedside alarm clock size device can do what theecho show can do i was concerned because i already had a large echo in mybedroom that answered to alexa like the other devices in my home i wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when i discoveredthat i had other name choices not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusioni named him echo now if i could only choose a male voice i loved that i could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell so many more features do not forget to buy thestand base so many advantages to having that read the reviews highly recommend
the best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house  there isn’t anything i dislike
i love this thing  i enjoy watching the daily news play music with lyrics most songs ordering my coffeeetc
easy to install and operate works with alexa voice commands
works good for the most part you ask it some questions and she says she does not know i thought she was supposed to know everything
six words alexa tell me a poop joke
enjoyed entire echo experience
when i got this echo i was excited to have a device with better sound than my dot and a hub to control some hue bulbswhat i did not realize and also was not fully communicated to me is that you can not use hue bulbs to their full potential with this device you can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors you also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for medo not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new iot devices if you do you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointlessi still love the echo and have zero complaints about the alexa functionality or sound quality of this device i am only disappointed with the hub's functionalities
i love how i can just push the microphone button on the remote and ask it to open any show and it will find whether it is on hulu or netflix and sign me in and start the show pretty amazing but each new technology sure is making me lazy or lol  
love the echo and how good the music sounds playing off it alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on spotify she is good with amazon music but is lacking in other major programs
 
looked brand new works great i love these echo dots and the refurbished ones are like new
not connected to my phone playlist 
for as awesome as the echo and echo dots are the spot is a disappointment there is very little control over what the screen shows what the clock looks like what order things show up in etc at this point if i had not thrown the box away immediately i would have sent it back and just got another full size echo
it is great for music a little hard to figure out how it works
speaker sounds good
love how it shows the song info on the screen if playing also time notifications news etc
easy to set up easy to use
love my alexa actually have 3 throughout the house favorite function is lists great for time management and if course music
i absolutely love my show
i like the interaction of asking questions i do not like that i can not ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp
love it we are still learning the capabilities having a lot of fun
works perfectly
it is fun to imagine the household management options some info questions baffle alexa but other options are cool   esp music related 
este producto llegó y a la semana se quedó sin olor perdió toda su escencia huele solo a alcohol
supberb sound definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music
the echo plus is used for leisure and pleasure i absolutely love it easy to set up and connect what a great addition to my listening pleasure i have not used it yet for other purposes
this makes a big difference in searching for programs so much easier then the older fire stick faster to
excellent purchase
same as new
cool
 
got a good deal and works great with prime  setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service  has worked great with nice sound from small speaker
i love alexa  i am surprised how much i use her
have not had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect it will be on it is way back to amazon
love the ease of use and convenience the echo spot has offered
i decided to buy smart door lock and decided on getting the echo plus to control it  i chose a kwikset 888 because amazon said it was compatible and i bought 2 dots while i was at it  and when i posed the question somebody in the community said it will work with alexa  what i did not know was the z wave lock and zigbee alexa hub weren't compatible  does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with echo plus  if not i guess my choices are 1 exchange the plus for a regular echo and buy a separate hub like wink  2 return the whole alexa system and get something elsei  do not want to just buy another hub to use along side my echo plus or i will be back here asking how to integrate two hubsthe reason i kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because i was afraid they wouldn't operate seamlessly and unfortunately i only do enough research after something does not work
i took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29 looks brand newno excuses or disappointments 5 minute trouble free set up effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the alexa app on my iphone was flawless listening to my favorite tunes through a bose bluetooth setup and could not be happier walk through the door and just ask alexa to play 80's music and viola instant atmosphere no more opening the ipad going to settings turning on bluetooth and then accessing the pandora app it just makes things so effortless a true joy right out of the box if i did not discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny
love love love
it is extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it does not answer everything i ask but it is still nice to use
the way the music sounds is poor quality
i like everything about this  im still learning how to use it
2nd one more to come
works as expected this is our fourth one our son loves it in his room easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it
este producto llegó y a la semana se quedó sin olor perdió toda su escencia huele solo a alcohol
my three year old loves it  good for doing basic household tasks  we are going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs
love everything about this product i bought two one for my household and one for my mother in law just so we can video chat with her and for emergency and it is easy to use for older folks
use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home
sent it back due to crackling noise and turning itself off and on   but what can you expect with a refurbished item
it was perfect  works like a charm
works great killer speaker my wife and son love it
works perfect no wear and tear on the device i love alexa working on making my home smart smile
works great and easy to set up
easy to set up and works like it is supposed to
i love it  you own personal secretary
love it
i am quite disappointed by this productthere clearly is a bug half of the time i ask for a newsflash two second after it starts the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes same goes when i ask to play the radio also many times it get confused when i ask to switch of the lightsas other items are also named the same which is not true clearly no ai or natural language very 'beta' stage still for me not impressed
i am in love with alexa
bye bye philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge  took a little tinkering had to rest the individual bulbs but works great no more philips hue bridge is not responding message
echos are great i have a few of them through out our home   all in voice range to ask a question say a command to turn lights on or off or my favorite is play music all though the house
overall i like this though siri on my phone can do more for what i need as i do not have a smart home and do not intend to make it one but it is fun and i use it for music and to have it read me my audible books
love that i have command access to news such as bloomberg tv npr etchighly recommend that you gain access to alexa app before setting up device and get familiar with key features servicessuch as setting up your daily commuteif family and friends have spotthen it is a great substitute for skype and face timeyou can always drop in when missing loved ones or just to catch up
i use this product for enjoyment and i just love it
show has been great still learning what it can do but being able to watch videos talk face to face with others are not features
works great to control the tv lights and various other devices lately i have been using it when i wake up and do not know what time it is but do not want to open my eyes just shout out alexa what time is it if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it would be golden sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect the echo plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive echo
got for elderly parentseasy for them to usejust instructions could be more informative
the greatest
exchange new color
love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen great to drop in on family around the house
i love it
it does what it says it will do  the picture quality is better than what i have been receiving on cable tv  only downside is if you pause the movie for more than a couple minutes it takes a long time to come back on and you often get a message that your internet speed is too slow i am clocking 300 mb at my house on a good day  also voice command through alexia does not work well but that could be operator error  all in all for $20 you can not beat it
i love this item i underestimated this item i have another 2 in my cart  but i am waiting for the same deal again i highly recommend this item
we have a few echos already went for this one in refurbished to save a few bucks it works great i love this new generation one because it has a rubber bottom   nice
amazon does not disappoint
worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock  however for the price it should come with the stand
really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house
easy setup alexa needs a lot of training
work pretty well
it is better than the 1st gen in every way except for one  i really miss the ring at the top for volume control  it was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the   one and press it a few times  i also wish the bass was a bit better  all in all it is a great device and i am happy with it
being able to add speakers is a plus i take it on my deck when i am outside just love it i have my big alexia in my bedroom
awesome device
i already have the echo plus  bought this one for my bedroom  love the functions
listening to music searching locations checking time looking up weather there are many more task to learn it was simple to set up
great and easy to use
i did not know it needed to be plugged in to work so far my experiences have been positive
installed on my back porch works very well  i did have to get the wall mount for it which also works well
not substitute for the original  the echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor  to listen it has to be at the highest level 10
fantastic product i use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program
alexa takes some getting used to but the picture quality is great the touch screen is very responsive and smooth speakers are better than expected as wellfour stars out of five
echo dot is a wonderful invention we love it alexa is so smart
love love love my amazon echo plus❤️❤️
nice it works goodsome times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times some time almost screaming
works great no different than the new ones
the speaker sounds really good
the alexa program is great but the quality is not the best it could definitely be louder
handy as hell 10 10 recommend
we bot 2 on prime day one for use as a clock radio in the bedroom and one in the family room to control lights and watch the front door when the doorbell rings  music sound is very good not as good as the echo but way better than our dots  if we could only buy 1 amazon device it would be the spot
love it do not know what took me so long to get one — and do not know why i did not get two on amazon prime day
not happy with the spot  reset numerous times  seems to be in slow mode  have to be practically on top of it for it to hear me  even after talking with support i still do not have themes in the menu to choose from
great streaming device
love it
my father liked the added programing in which he is interested
i loved talking it out of the box and being able to easily set up
its great lots of fun
perfect condition
i like the compact structure of the dot the sound is a little too low
if you do not have an echo you definitely need one
it seems a little less intuitive then the regular echo plus it is also a little harder for it to pick up what you're saying  when combined with the other four we have in the household having to speak loud enough for it to hear was cross activating other ones so we had to rename this one  overall it works well but does not seem as adept at doing things as the original echo plus
alarm calendar reminders
i love having alexa around the house my favorite features are her timers alarms and music especially her library of sleep sounds i got this product as a gift for my kids and they love her too she is great for reading time and timing 30 minutes for itthe only thing i really do not like is that she has to be plugged in to an outlet to function no ifs ands or buts i get why but it is minorly inconvenient as i have to move her from room to room or purchase more lol
it was easy to use for our bedroom tv
love love love these the only think i notice is that it does not pick up my voice and commands as well as my echo and echo dots we have 4 echo products throughout our house i have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock i am no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists
i got it to try side by side with the echo originale they are essentially the same in dimension weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub as many folks already pointed out the hub is not a direct replacement for the philips hue z wave or anything else it provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub for me the voice recognition and music play capability is the same the original echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i do not really need the hub with less functionality in addition i do not think that amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed my philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs fw and they fixes bugs net net for me this echo does not do anything more than the original echo and sound quality is not as good with the  original echo available as refurbished i would check that out first before considering this or the new echo which is clearly inferior to both of these
easy setup was up and running in minutes the learning feature is outstanding now i know why amazon is so far ahead of the competition
 
this worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet wifi and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked  amazon customer service could not help further and told me warranty was only 3 months which was very disappointing so they weren't willing to replace
works as described  a+++++
alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development speech recognition fails to understand basic american and british accentthe music it can play is very restrictive speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a almost a human is speaking linking to youtube via amazon web services does not work
love alexa hope have her in every room soon
we enjoy it
works fine i wanted this for my bedroom television
i enjoy this little thing a lot  will do almost anything  i like the jokes it tells  i am still learning different functions
this product is beautifully designed and i no longer have to hide an echo device away like i did with dot it would be nice if amazon would lose that camera though which i have not used and might cause squirms for the privacy conscious
very good quality and you do not have to yell or be close for it to work and understand you properly
speaker is better than 1st generation echo
works great perfect for my office
love the echo dot it is amaxing
mainly use it for the music but i am learning more all the time  really nothing bad to say about it
i bought this for myself and i did not realize it had to be plugged in just to work it isn’t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall it should’ve been more clear when i bought it
the power cord attachment tends to come loose from the outlet the adapter may be too long and heavy not a big problem but annoying when the unit is plugged in it works great
i love using my echo show for music it sounds amazing unfortunately the video quality when video chatting isnt great my husband and i video chat often and his video comes out very clear on my end but he says my image is very pixelated i am still learning to use it but so far so good
very nice gadget love it is look
es  excelente funciona genial
this is my first digital assistant so i am giving this a good review speaker is really good for the cheap price on prime day fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock that's what i was going to get in the first place but i ended up with echo if you have not had a go with one then definitely try itwhat i like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with my purchase came with a smart plug for $10 which i connect my lamp to alexa turn of the lights
i love it
product does not  light bar never went orange  i googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions i tried both  product is defective
i love it i can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz not easy to find on local radio sound is good and i can stop it with a voice command if i get a phone call
come on   it is amaonmazing  it is way more than a smart speaker  it is my wake up alarm my security blanket and infotainment center all in one  it is my connection to the world during night hours when i am mostly sleepy or zonked out zzzzzzz  i can still access the world without my reading glasses late at night  it sounds amazing for its size  it can hear me when i am far from awake mostly  as they say this is a must have device  yep that is a true statement
so far so good
device has great speakers and the screen quality is phenomenal
i love alexa she rocks
really easy to use
love this device
bought this for my son and he loves it
i loved it does exactly what it says
love it convenient responsive learns voices within the household best assistant so far
i love this device  i bought it simple so that i can have an alarm clock with my amazon echoand during prime day for the price you could not beat it  but i have sonos and big ass fan lights that i am able to control with this device  it is perfect and getting better all the time
excellent
great
much easier to use than the dot it picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding the screen is a nice perk but i only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed the screen is too small to watch showsit displays my alarm in print so i know alexa heard me correctly and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures  my only complaint is that they do not add the stand as standard i did not need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bedmany people complain about the basic alexa program but it is still such new tech that i am not going to split hairs  the echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot  alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly now alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice i think amazon is working overtime on this project i gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anythingi am so used to my alexa that i talk to her even when i am staying in a hotel and she's no where to be found  alexa what time is it  alexa
great product but useless overall too many unnecessary features unless you have a smart home you do not need it
more compact and a bit better than the original
got it specifically to work with the august smart lock and it connected to it with ease  definitely ties the smart home together
love my new addition to the house speaker quality is great and over all we love our alexa my only two  not complaints more suggestions for the future series would be better communication ability example for our smart lights in the house unless we specify kitchen light 1 or kitchen light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she does not recognize it may be me but i want my alexa to respond when i say thank you afterwards i have to repeat alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me but will my husband i know it sounds odd we laugh about it but maybe it is a southern thing but i want my alexa to have manners too
i can not live without alexa
 
versatile and fun 
i love it plays great music movies and so much more i does lag when u want to see your arlo security cameras thou so far so good wish it had a longer cord
i love my echo plus the only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors
being able to use it with my alexa echo was great
love being able to listen to music easily still learning all the features available
met and exceeded my expectations easy set up and is really quick in responses
upgraded from a first generation firestick i do not know why i waited so long i love it
easy to set up and does everything it is a poster despite its small size the speakers are adequate understands instructions from across the room very happy with the purchase
i had an alexia built into my thermostat that just did not work very well i had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it i decided to try the echo dot since it was on prime day i have not been disappointed it hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem i really like that i can bluetooth connect to my bose speaker for quality sound
great sound
if you do not have an echo you definitely need one
i love my echo dot has many features and works greatthe only thing i do not like about it is that i can not play my imusic on it i am going to have to pay for a spotify or amazon music account
love it easy setup and i can ‘drop in’ on my daughter and son in law who live in st louis anytime everyone loves to have their mother drop in right 😎
it is very convenient but wish i could request more music
 
it is very slow compared to the echo
the sound from this echo 2nd generation is phenomenal  not to mention that i just love alexa  she is very helpful
better sound
i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo if you are a big fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use  if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj you can even have conversations with the echo i am not embarrassed to say that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke it tells me where my packages are since i am an amazon prime addict it comes in extremely  handy
works as expected
great sound and easy to set up
fun to play with
great sound from a little speaker
so far it seems to be a very nice item it picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems the other day i asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine i have only used it to listen to music and check the weather but it has done both of those things very well
it has great sound and very responsive to commands
i do love these things i have them running my entire home tv all my lights my thermostat my front door dead bolt the cameras and i love listening to npr these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek i named mine computer to get the feel but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems
purchased this for the man cave and loving it
 
i love my echo dot has many features and works greatthe only thing i do not like about it is that i can not play my imusic on it i am going to have to pay for a spotify or amazon music account
what a great little gadget for the house you ask and it delivers period well done
alexa is phenomenal
like it still working discovery really too soon to fully evaluate but looking forward to learning and using it
the musicthe shopping list and the sound
love it it is everything i wanted and more
works great and has been fun to use
love everything about this
i bought this because it can control fios television it works well i am hoping over time it will do more to control fios then i discovered all the other things alexa can do play music you ask for great sound from alexa play games play radio stations play old time radio programs like the long ranger alexa has many apps you can add to her abilities the other day i played madlibs great fun also alexa can control household appliances i just purchased alexa compatible power strips to control lighting fans and tv components i am looking forward to implementing this controll you can also add other alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located
alexa is phenomenal
i love it  using music and turning on and off light
i am completely in love does absolutely everything and is so amazing and great
simply amazing what a awsome device it never ceases to amaze me wake up to big bang music go to sleep softly falling rain drop in on the kids and keep in touch i have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do
i bought and love them alexa is very convenient
amazon fire stick is amazing 
i looooooove this thing  watching movies on it is a bit of a disaster because of the round screen but other than that it is a great chachki toy 
recently cut the cord on cable television needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap ordered the amazon fire stick from best buy instructions were short and easy to follow i was going to order the amazon ethernet adapter because i was worried about wireless speeds in my area but thought i would wait and see glad i did wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far a few brief hiccups here and there but i am convinced that was from the apps themselves do not miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what i used to watch for a much lower price which right now is a total of $50 a month amazon fire stick is limited to 1gb of memory and 8gb of storage thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading apps and recording shows so far it has not been any issue at all the upcoming fall tv schedule which includes the return of nfl football might prove more troublesome when i need to record more often i will worry about that then my only real issue is that you can not really turn it off the screen remains on and uses up electricity although probably small amounts luckily when you unplug it all downloaded apps and recorded shows stay in memory not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it is unplugged have not tried it yet although i do not think it will be an issue with directtv now which i am using right now so far i am loving the amazon fire stick actually love that amazon which i use occasionally come pre installed
the sound on these is terrible it is like a tin can i love my echo but this item is awful
i love my echo plus i use it with my spotify account to find my phone make phone calls  turn our lights off and on much more most importantly it reads story to my children  they love it and that makes me happy
we love our fire stick the alexa voice control is fantastic for my younger kids
love listening to music still trying to learn everything it does
works like a charm
i love the number of movies that are available using this device took me a little time to setup and learn how to work it the only thing i miss is local channels
excellent why did not i think it is in the beginning i love it
it is very smart and sweet design
my husband and i are what i would call late adopters when it come to technology but we decide we would try and echo to serve primarily as a music source  wow were we amazed and the great sound  we have also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking alexa  i may even buy one for my elderly dad   i think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us
so far so good  not to tech savvy so i am still trying to figure out what i can do with it but it was easy to set up and so far easy to use  lots of apps that it can use  i will have to play with it some more but its fun to have
it does everything  the big guy does
dont trust this
bought two of them and both work great i am not much on electronics running my home but alexa does all that i want and need to be done
easy to set up
love it i have listened to songs i have not heard since childhood i get the news weather information it is great
we have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors  can not wait to try more new stuff using alexa
works well
love the feature to play music in every room with multiple echos
it is annoying that everything they show alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded you spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself
great
works great
i bought it for my sister and she has not had any complaints yet so i think it is great
love this for bedside clock alarm radio  face can dimat night so it is not bright for sleeping
i am loving my new echo show the video screen adds so much more value and potential movies tv shows song lyrics all extra features that are available with the echo show oh it also has a built in camera for taking pics
sometimes while playing a game you can answer a question correctly but alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you  i like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home
i love the size and the videos are a good quality  the sound is awesome too
so far not impressed at all does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time i am not sure what the excitement is all about alexas voice sounds like it is under water how am i supposed to understandi am going to return and try a google home
i like this product however the set up was a bit difficult i had to reset it to the factory setting abd start from scratch
i love my new echo  it gives me hours of music and help with other thingsit was difficult for me to set it up  i had to have help from a tekkie
excellent bought another one yesterday
i bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and i was excited when it came in the next day i set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine the set up was easy and straight forward which i really appreciated because i am terrible with technology the only reason why i am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that i can not use the echo dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet i am connected to both 24ghz and 5ghz wifi links and neither works it is very frustrating because i am not getting my use out of the echo dot and i really wish i could if any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know
i am extremely impressed with this item bought it from the warehouse or outlet with a minor imperfection can not tell it even has one works great did not come in packaging but it was sealed up and had no damage and was not missing anything i like the sound quality i see some knock it it is not a bose but it is more than great for our family easy to use minor learning curve as it learns your voice it integrates seamlessly with my other amazon servicescan not wait to get for my classroom too it is a lot of fun even just as a speaker let alone what i plan to do with it
love my echo
does not always respond when spoken to with promp word i thought it would connect to my echo upstairs and use it like an intercom have not been able to do that
good but it is pretty low
love it still learning all the possibilities
we are so glad that we got the echo over a bluetooth speaker alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there i personally love the timer feature it has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously pandora integration is another feature that i use daily so happy with out prime day purchase i will get the echo hub and a few more echo dots in the future
i have no complaints as far as i know these are exactly like new just a little cheaper great
i dislike that it confuses my requests all the time
good sound like it for music and scheduling like that i can get random thoughts recorded while i think about them the jokes are cute
convenient and fun
it works
the sound is fantastic for the classic  music is like you have the orchestra at your home and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top but also you can tell  alexa volume 3
i really love the hub feature
upgraded from my lilttle echo dot happy with sound
it is fantastic very happy with the purchase
we put one in the bedroom  it plays music and tells us the weather  it also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning  it is better than a clock radio  it will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites  it can even tell jokes  i do not know how i got along without it before now  amazing
love alexa love the echo dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom
overall love it there are just some commands which aren't effective it may be part user error or alexa becoming accustom to what is being asked
so far just ok
i do like the fire stick and i am very close to cutting the cable  i can find many movies and shows while keeping my budget in check  i am learning how to maneuver around the channels and find my shows quickly
i am having trouble connecting my tv to it but i am not exactly tech smart i am sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me so far i have been using it mostly for music
i love you alexa
love it  great product
i do not know why i like it but i do it is like an all in one alarm clock  if you have other alexa devices you know what it is  if you are looking to get an alarm clock this is the one to get yes its much more than that  it shows you the time it shows you the weather its touch screen it shows you music lyrics and it does all the things your typical alexa device does  it is quite loud for its size as well sound way better than echo dot  it also does video calling which is pretty awesome  the viewing angle is great so even if its sitting fairly high up you can still see the display well enough
tried to play certain broadway shows like camelot and it gives ne the group camelot
works and sounds great my house is barely 1100sf and i have this sitting on my kitchen counter i can hear it and speak to it from any room lots of functionality still to discover
easy to set up and to use
like everything about it the music the trivia games the weather
great love the display and easy to use though still learning what all it can do everyday
i love it it does everything
alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time
i love it wife hates it
it works great
i love my echo it is easy to operate loads of funit is everything as advertised i use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test alexa's knowledge
 
 
i am impressed with the quality of sound that the echo has it is definitely comparable to my bose mini i only gave 4 stars because i can not use my apple music account
satisfied with the purchase
amazing
i am spoiled by one downstairsso got this one for upstairs to listen to music  etc while i walked on the treadmill
love the echo show
clear sound great alarm clock plays my music  what else can you ask for  oh yeah you can order what you need
this is our 5th amazon echo device  we have purchased refurbished before and been satisfied this time is no different  you can not tell this from brand new and the price was $10 cheaper  our echo's wake us up keep timers play music for us act as encyclopedias turn our lights on and off and so much more
technology in such a small device the price was good too the sound is amazing a must have feature for any home
got this as a gift and love it i never would have bought one for myself but now that i have it allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music  that's worth it in and of itself  also gives new's briefs and tells jokes
great addition to my echo plus
set up was simple it recognizes my voice well it seams very intuitive i am enjoying its ease of use
quick and easy to set up
works well need to speak clearly but picks up commands from a good distance and the sound is surprisingly well
better than expected
love this
really disappointed alexa has to be plug in to wall socket all the time  my fault for not checking this but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery  if i could return it i would as my apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the alexa
i had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone i ended up using my computer it is interesting that the answers come from wikipedia however i will give echo dot an a in the music playing department i heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations also amusing when alexa responds i do not know that why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing if i had paid full price for this gadget i would have been sorely disappointed now it seems reasonable and a step above hal
clear sound great alarm clock plays my music  what else can you ask for  oh yeah you can order what you need
still learning how to ise it but is does not disappoint i am giving to everyone for christmas so i can check in on them unnannounced like they do mejust show up with no advanced warning
fun to work with still learning everything she can do
alarmbed time story universal
that it does not turn my television on or off
works good  microphone is not as good as the better echo products
 
easy to set up and sooooooo many things it can do  just awesome
we just got this within the last couple of weeks from what we can tell no issues my son wanted and alexa for his 6th birthday so she could tell him jokes he could ask her questions and to listen to music she does all of that and more we all enjoy this one so much that i just bought a second one this week during prime deals day
too difficult to set up  it keeps timing out before you can enter the password
fun just got it today now my i pod will go in my car and i will use this is the house
i sure love alexa  lol  thank you  great price and product
i am the training coordinator at my company and i have used the amazon blueprints skill with an echo device and echo buttons to create my own gameshow quiz for new hire orientation training i am always looking for new ways to engage trainees in order to make learning more enjoyable i believe that if someone enjoys the process of learning then they're much more likely to remember the information so far this has been a huge success with my classes and i look forward to amazon improving and building out the blueprints skill further
great product
absolutly love it 
love my new alexa she works great so far
i like it
i love itshe is very helpful i use her for remembering things and sleep you can ask her just about anything i have only had her for about a week so still learning her
easy setup with great sound i would rate this unit a 10 +++++ and a must have for the office and home l am looking add other devices locks and lights for my home
my 2nd one and i use them all the time
this was a prime day purchase i am still learning my way around it so far so good the addition of alexa is nice
still love it
work pretty well
had a little trouble at the beginning until i replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees  like when it was 91 degrees alexa would say it was 81 degrees  otherwise everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from amazon and my pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist
love it
pretty cool i have only begun to figure out things she does
this was an add on for my echo system the refurbished product works like new
have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great
echo spot works well except it does not work with the ring doorbell as it states on the website since they were sold as a pair i thought that it would be app ready  unfortunately that is not case  perhaps ring will update so that they can be integrated
a+
i am so happy that i purchased alexa  when i recently saw this at a friend's home he played some music while talking about the product  i love the sound & love that all i have to do is tell alexa or ask a question & she responds immediately  i have not been able to listen to my cd's for a while since i have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it is not an issue any longer
i liked linking two more rooms in the home
i love it wife hates it
works awesome
this is the best amazon speaker with alexa in it  but if you’re thinking it is a good smart hub you’re wrong are you can do is connect your smart lights and devices to it and tell alexa to turn them on and off that’s it you’re better off buying separate hubs so you have more control of your devices
i really love my dots so awesome how it is connects all my rooms but like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume which i am sure if i connected it to speaker or another device it would be great but as a stand alone the volume is just ok definitely not like my tall echo and the dots do not pick up voice as good as my tall echostill totally love them and would recommend 100%
got to love alexa she does everything around our house
so far i am very pleased with my echo show  the problem is there’s so much it can do that i have not been able to explore the extent of its abilities i got the special price as part of the prime day promotionand you just can not beat what you get for the price  very pleased with the sound the video screen is sharp sometimes it takes a few tries to get alexa to perform a commandbut as i get to know the system better i am hoping that will improve  one drawback in the musici have noticed a lot of the songs from years past are re recordings by the original artistbut not the original recording itself  example secret agent man by johnny riversa liveversion is used not the original version  if i am going to pay for prime musici would like to hear the original version of songsnot later recordings  or at least give me a choice of what i want to hear  otherwise i am very pleased with my echo show  so pleased in fact that i bought a second one
works like a champ
all the music i can listen too also the movie i can watch i can see my ring doorbell 
love the product but dislike that i can not sync up my apple music for alexa to play
it isn’t bad for what it is have issues with it actually playing what i want getting it use iheartradio properly by playing the station i want is a challenge but it is not bad for the sale price i paid
 
never would know it was refurbished
i love the echo show i have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months  but the show is so much better  the sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4k tv  i love being able to see my timers events and list instead of having them read to me  i purchased this on prime day and it is worth every penny  when the dot was given to me i thought this is a cute novelty  but i will probably never use it was i wrong  echo is part of my daily routine  and has made my life so much easier
was not so sure about bringing smart technology into my home but i am hooked i love the sleek look of the echo spot on my nightstand and how easy it was to set up and use i also love that it scrolls the news local weather and give suggestions of what to ask alexa i use this as my alarm clock speaker and have it sync'd with the etekcity voltson wi fi smart plugs to control the lighting in my apartment
i put it on a tv that did not have a great picture and it now looks like a new tv
it is just not as loud as i thought it was going to be
i am completely in love does absolutely everything and is so amazing and great
works great  seems to be a delay bringing up ring cameras but sound and video quality are good
set up was simple it recognizes my voice well it seams very intuitive i am enjoying its ease of use
as an alexa device it works just as well as any of the other products  unfortunately it does not go up from there  the ability to play videos is very limited  you can not play youtube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange there is quite a selection of clock faces and you can control what is displays with one glaring and very annoying exception  you can not turn off the things to try screen you can turn off the screen scroll but that defeats the purpose of having the screen  i do not need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things i can do with alexa  i do not need the advertising especially at the cost of this device  overall its an expensive alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying  i would not recommend this until the amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that's actually useful
i set up the echo dot and it worked for an hour and then died completely do not buy refurbished i sent back for return the day after i received
use as my 3rd dot bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and does not have access to phone
beyond my capabilities to program grandkids lve it
love these  great sound easy to connect and use
i love this so much alexa is even better when she can show you things
have not used it yet but i am sure it is as great as the others i can not get over how amazing the echo  echo dots are this has to be some of the greatest technology that has ever came out
fun and  information  no dislikes  so far  like the convenience
ask it to play motown radio on pandora and it keeps asking if i want to add a salsa station motown isn’t close to salsa phonetically
the echo dot 2nd generation smart speaker is very compound in size however it  projects very good sound it also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound i also like it size because it is not awkward and it does not take up a lot of space it works great with the alexa app i also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing
i purchased the echo plus with the build in hub so i could have the convenience of asking alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off  philips hue light bulbs were placed in the fixtures that i wanted alexa to control and they all work great  i already had an echo dot in my kitchen den area so i placed the echo plus with hub in my bedroom my radio and lamps in my kitchen and den are controlled with tp link plugs  but the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my den and bedroom have special philips hue light bulbs that are controlled by the hub inside the echo plus  i am able to play music set my alarm get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices  the echo dot requires a tp link plug to be plugged into it and the echo plus requires a special philips light bulbs installed in each light fixture to work  the only thing i dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with alexa and  the echo plus with hub  other than the high price of the bulbs i love my echo plus with built in hub
easy to setup and use the ability to play video is huge addition on alexa device family
alexa was able to call my phone when i could not find it and also turned on and off the light when commanded  then i came home a day later and it wouldn’t turn on the light but would shut it off  then she said i had no devices could not find my phone  now working again  we will see  love the selection of music
perfect for kids adults and everyone in between
i love it
i love my echo smart speaker  i love the volume and clarity  it was easy to set up  its a wonderful gift for any age
i like echo spot i bought it to use as an alarm clock one negative that i didnt really think about when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes in this case a clock with buttons seems to work better
so far no major issues
very easy setup
love that the fire stick allows me enough choices to ditch cable
good value
love it
i enjoy seeing lyrics on the screen for different amazon music stations
nice
super easy set up and am loving our new echo
i am really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device  the bass sounds almost like it is coming from a bigger speaker so props to amazon
i love my fire stick
it is so easy to use and is everything i hoped for
i used it to control my smart home devices works great
i try use with yale lock but isn’t work
i expected to have access to more current movie instead of having to pay the easy setup was helpful and i love the speedy delivery
fast to load but keeps rebooting  in middle of shows
i have been hesitant to purchase anything smart home because i am just not good with electronics  however this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the bluetooth in my sound bar for my tv which provides extra sound for music i can make calls and finally hear people when home i do not have cable only the paid apps like netflix and hulu so when alexa provided me news stations weather and other updates it was really great to hear i have linked all of my accounts to her she turns on my lights before i walk through the door she purchases re orders off of amazon for my pets and i heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not  this is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone  my tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her must buy
this was purchased for our toy hauler but it came the day before we left for a trip by plane  it was wonderful to plug into our hotel tv and watch our normal tv shows rather than whatever was showing at the time and sit through commercials
loved it wish i would have bought one sooner
works like a charm
love it makes the simple things in life simpler
i am obsessed with alexa she tells me the weather every morning she can play games we love the guess the song one and the one we have upstairs can turn off our tv downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if alexa will do it for you
this thing is great has good sound and does everything i expected i have it linked in with my lights and use it with alarmcom as well
easy to use and has great soundit was a great purchase at a great price
we have only been using alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy it like having a new household member we are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it
the sound is amazing and many collections of all music
very good to be able to listen to every single song at any time in amazon's vast library we are only just beginning to know everything echo show has to offer well worth the price alexa is very helpful
i like when thete nothing to watch on tv i can run to my firestick
 
alexa is perfect for people like me living alone at least i have someone to talk to to keep my sanity 😂 though i wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers
i got this for my mom  she loves it 
the first stick is a solid entry level device and does what it is supposed to do
we like it a lot sound is better than the original echo the bass feels deeper  the screen is cool though havent got a lot of use out of it though
easy to set up and does everything it is a poster despite its small size the speakers are adequate understands instructions from across the room very happy with the purchase
love it
still learning about the echo show but so far we love it my 9 year old loves to cook and especially with his aunt that lives out of state and now he can connect with her and they cook together
easy to connect and the skills created for our echo 2nd gen worked fine with the dot
was surprised to learn this can be used as a bluetooth speaker for phones and tablets it probably lists it in the description but i missed that part  it not quite the surround like quality of a bluetooth speaker in the $100+ range but its very good none the less  and with even basic access to amazon music there is a lot to listen to  there's a huge number of things alexa can do learning more every day
great addition to the alexa family  nice having the visual part of pics recipes etc
i bought two one for my office and one for my bedside table they are fantastic the screen is just big enough when using the drop in feature to communicate with my mom i can not wait for prime day again to get one for my moms bedside table
usual reliable alexa
 
got this for my 2nd echo in the house i already have the regular echo  the echo dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable wishing i would have just gone with another regular echo solely based on sound
can watch amazon prime shows and talk to alexus
i love how it is alexa enabled i just say the show i want to watch and she knows how and where to find it for me
easy to install and use
great buy bought this to go with my echo and love it the speaker isn’t the best for music but works great in a kitchen for timers or alarms
did t really know what i could use this device for used it for a few things but need an overview
great
awesome
i love it it is just what i thought it would be  i am addicted
love the echo  i love the size material and speaker quality i have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat next is echo dot for bedroom there is a lot more to do with echo that you think traffic weather trivia etc
i like it as an alexa device but its small
great product
i love you so much
sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose
i love this product so far only because of the few things i can do with itsuch as set a timer a reminder play music and games i do not like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things it was also very difficult to set up the directions made it sound as simple as one two three but they forgot about step four five and six i was almost ready to send to backthe app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up however depending on what you are going to be using it for i think it is an ok item
works perfect
gave as a gift   they loved it
i am really hoping for skills that take advantage of the shows touch screen there’s an incredible amount of untapped potential locked behind the restrictions make use of the best part of having the show and enable skills to navigate by touch please
i like being able to watch pretty much anything i want at anytime works great
i like my amazon fire stick i use it for my tv thank you for your help when i called you to get further instructions how to use it thank you have a good evening
alarm and music information the weather
i like the looks better than the original echo  i moved my old echo to the basement family room nice sound
still learning what it can do amazing simple works right out of a box only frustration is getting amazon alexa app t show up on my samsung galaxy with google's android
was loving it but starting in june hulu stopped working and crunchyroll does not work either probably will switch to something else soon
good shape
love love so far i just received it thursday i unwrapped it set it up & immediately programmed it no problem with the reoccurring things to try i set it to rotate once and shows time like i want i love the low ambient look at night
amazingly fun my daughter and i just asked questions on the first day i have now set my daily alarm weekend reminder playlist morning shows random songs daily bible verses weather and morning commute it tells me which way to go dodging traffic you have to get one i do not have it linked to my phone yet
initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great
 
invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to creapy af
alread had echos and dots but the ability to control philips hue bulbs nudged me to buy this on prime day  another fun product from amazon
superb is all we can say  plugged the unit in set up the hdmi and boom we were watching better tv  thank you
works like a charm
diversity so many things to see and hear wealth of information
my new best friend 
very pleased
without having a cellphone i cannot use many of her features i have an ipad but do not see that of any use  it is a great alarm  if u r almost deaf you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room so that is reason enough to keep herit is fun to ask random questions to hear her response  she does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet
it does what it needs to
love it
plays great
this is our second echo show  we have a home in mexico and one in the usa  now when one of us is in the other home we can easily stay in touch and see each other  we can also drop in on the houses when we aren’t there to check on them  we use it to turn on and off the lights and security systems in both homes  we also have echo dots in various rooms  we love all this technology  we ask her many questions and she plays music for us
i bought this specifically so my wife could look at our arlo security cameras from the bedroom when i am at work the system worked for three days and now it just gives me a error message very disappointed due to the fact that they advertise that these systems work together i gave four stars because it does everything else very well
absolutely love
the simplicity of use and setting up
i have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it i set morning alarms check the weather have alexa play various music i bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound and i am learning her skills a little tricky to connect to wifi initially but after some trial and error it connected and has stayed connected so far super satisfied will be buying one for my mother and one for my office
i love my fire stick
it works ok this speaker quality is not much better than my iphone x i would spend the extra money to get the full size echo which has great sound quality
this thing is awesome we watch it more then the regular cable going to by more on black friday as christmas gifts
a great investment alexa has helped me out and made me laugh
i bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better  i will ship this to my daughter though because i like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now
i absolutely love it  it is just what l needed and more  i did not realize that the remote included voice remote  how convenient  i am so glad that l made that purchase
i never thought i was going to be that person that is completely connected i purchased this and another echo product on prime day and fell in love  i have one in my office and one in our kitchen  i have already used this for morning briefings from the news while i am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes  the screen is big enough for me to easily read writing this was a concern for me  i loved this so much i purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools  note i did purchase camera covers even though there is a button to turn off the camera and microphone and it does not impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about there are work around
easy to set up  i am enjoying the added video choices for my television
i love my echo it is easy to operate loads of funit is everything as advertised i use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test alexa's knowledge
great
is as expected and more responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the amazon app i also bought the philipshue light bulb and all i had to do was put it in my lamp and tell alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands
great product
quite niceclear great sound
fun and useful we are still learning new tricks and useful functionalities this is the future of human to computer interface and household automation just like star trek who knew it would be here so soon
love the echo show  being able to see the lyrics of the songs as they play or to be able to put a recipe up on the screen is wonderful
love it love it
very helpful with daily activities
still learning it we have just started integrating the smart devices in our home with the echo product line we now have the show the spot two dots and a kids dot having trouble getting them to call each other but still working on it
works great
the speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy  i bought two and the reason i only rate it a 3 is i have followed the instructions for synching music to both units  i know i have done it correctly but they won't sync  that was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units
great price great product fire stick is the best i think works better then roku
love alexa  i own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit
bought the spot and loved it within months it started acting funny and would stop working—called and they determined that it was overheating i was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24 48 hours waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week a week goes by with absolutely no response so i do the inline chat per instructions told to wait longer really  unacceptable—expected more from amazon find it funny how they always thank me for being a prime member but when an issue arises i cannot even get assistance
my android would not allow alexa to connect fortunately my sister was here with her apple cell after an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches we are up and running
it was a little hard to follow their instructions great product
needs to be smarter
i love my fire stick it is so easy to use
i did not order it
works great to watch youtube and amazin video
love love love
i am an original purchaser of the echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and i have always loved it i expanded my alexa usage by adding a few echo dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an echo plus let me tell you what great choice as much as i love my original echo the plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable the sound is great and the fact that it is got a built in hub for the philips hue lights is a huge plus
this is a fun toy  my daughter have me it  it reads to me
it has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start even from a distance a lot of the skills are excellent i have added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it is ridiculous that it can not access youtubeit might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event i imagine this is a functionality people would use often
fun item to play with and get used to using  sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask but i think it will be better
love the product  use to turn on my lights and answer some quick questions
works great   i put this in my son's room and use the drop in option to get his attention when he is gaming or watching tv
love it
works good however the price went down the week after i purchased it
i was on beta list for alexa have a show an original alexa 4 echo's and i actually like this the best even more than show
absolutely love it after much persuasion from a friend i finally gave in and bought one let's just say that the moment alexa enters my life i turn around and tell siri to get the hell out
love it i got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes we love it
i had some trouble with my echo dot when i first got it because of internet connection issues after doing research online i saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation echo dot however the same weekend i took a trip and brought my echo dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine now back home the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it is little rough patch and i have not had any problems since so if you are having connection issues with an echo dot then it is probably the internet and not the device
for the size of the screen this thing should be $25
this is my first alexa device and it is so fun to discover all of the ways to use it the biggest con with me is the drop in feature it is pretty creepy
never had any issue with buying use electronics as long as i get the good or like new just read the comment to see why it is used
i am not tec smart enough to make it work at all will send it back if i cant get help my eco dot works just fine this is too complacatedi just wanted a bigger speaker
product stopped working after return time ran out
this refurbished item was finebut i was not aware that there is a fee for having other echos set up in the rooms  however it was missing the cordthank you
this is so much fun to play with   i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell alexa to turn it of   alexa learns from the questions i ask she will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain if i wake up in the middle of the night i do not have to turn on a light i just ask alexa what time is it when i want the current weather she tells me ask her what going on in the city she knows call a friend she will dial  i have not used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts
fun so farstill learning how it all works
love my amazon products
nice toy to have around
amazing product
my husband likes being able to use it to listen to music  i wish we knew all it is capabilities
echo dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time
we use alexa primarily for listening to music and checking the weather we are still learning other ways to use her everything has been ready and hands free so far the speaker has great volume and sound
love alexa bought others for friends
eh it is works on and off half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name other then that works fine
i really like it works well trivia games and shopping on it is funsometimes it misunderstands what i say but other then that the speaker is decent video chat is good but you do need to be in a well lit room so the other end can see you lol
works great i recommend it to anyone who has prime wifi and an hdm1 tv that’s all u need i am not really technologically savvy but even i was able to set it up with included and on screen directions
great product works well
great
4 out of 5 stars i have the original tall echo 4 dots 2 spots and 1 show  the only thing i am finding a problem with is the speakers in the spot when using drop in  sometimes i am not being heard on the other spot and vice versa  the voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent the optical is fine it is just the sound sometimes i will have to repeat the wake word 2 3 times and i am only 8 feet away plus it is on one of those $20 stands  i find the echo dot original echo and the show has much better sound quality  that's one reason i bought the echo show
these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house lol we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs
being able to add speakers is a plus i take it on my deck when i am outside just love it i have my big alexia in my bedroom
i love the sound very good we use it for home automation also works well
awesome product more than expected
good sound like it for music and scheduling like that i can get random thoughts recorded while i think about them the jokes are cute
usual reliable alexa
it is a good addition to my small space and it keeps me up to date on events and weather conditions
speaker sounds good
it talks to me plays the type of music i want to listen to and even turns off when i ask if to
i wanted to use this as a bedside clock with the ability to play music and podcasts sadly it continuously scrolls the things to try and won't stay on the clock face amazon is about to get this one back
 
better sound
perfect
 
it takes a while to learn the uses and i am still learning
works decent wish it was able to answer more questionsneed a better source for info but the rest works great
 
i love it learning knew things with it eveyday still figuring out how everything works but so far it is been easy to use and understand she does make me laugh at times
still learning it
the echo does not come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it makes it quite inconvenient
excelente lo unico es que no esta en español
i use this to control my smart home
it knows everything  we ask it to do havent smart hubbed it yet but does exactly as advertised and am very happy with our purchase sound quality is excellent also
nice product
the firestick is easy to use and was super easy to set up  i like the platform and feel it is better than i expected  i was worried about it lagging but it has not at all  i am hoping to utilize the firestick to eventually break away from cable and now i am more confident that it can happen
nope still a lot to be improved for most of the things we ask it says hmmmm i dont know that
it works great the speaker sounds fine and overall would recommend
i like it and still learning how to use it
good
love it so great to use
been debating on getting one but am happy i did still more to explore thanks
 
very pleasedsimple to figure out
it is great
love itjust like the other 4 i own
smaller than i thought it would be happy i got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table
does not know half the things asked can not recognize my sprinkler wifi controller even though product details says it is compatible can not program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router just a handy music player that's if you have amazon music
i like that it respond most of my comands great product
i love it it does everything
i love it pretty cool
without having a cellphone i cannot use many of her features i have an ipad but do not see that of any use  it is a great alarm  if u r almost deaf you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room so that is reason enough to keep herit is fun to ask random questions to hear her response  she does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet
i am having trouble with it the alarm most of times does not work the timer does not ends and alexa keeps saying she is unavailable
i bought this to replace a dot in my living room speaker is slightly better it hears me better over the tv unfortunately it does not understand or respond to my requests as well as the dot i frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what i want the dot usually does exactly what i want on the first request i do not consider it an upgrade
very cool product speaker sounds good with my spotify blasting through it
very cool product easy to setup fun to use and sound quality is much better than i anticipated
alexa rocks
it performs pretty much as expected but i am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology i need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the amazon music service  i understand my music choices may be limited but without knowing how to ask i cannot access the music that is provided free along with my echo purchase  do you have a chart showing the language i need to use
i love it it is awesome
already owning a couple of echos i was frustrated that i could not also use them as intercoms finally amazon enables the drop in feature so now i can use my echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinneras for its other features we mainly use our echos for the standard stuff playing music setting alarms answering questions etc it is not the life changing home device amazon would have you believe but it is convenient to have around this refurb saved me a few bucks looks and works the same as the other brand new ones
love love love this  i have an echo and several echo dots but love the video with this and the clock  i no longer have to wake up and say alexa what time is it or alexa weather  i can even watch videos on it if i forget my kindle before bed
i like it
love it
the echo does not come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it makes it quite inconvenient
great hub
awesome device wish i bought one ages ago
absolutely love it  only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable  when playing  music with  bluetooth speaker outside i have to go inside to change songs
loved all about it all i can do with it and it looks good
use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home
love it
best looking echo device easy to use
good wifi tv stick
 
great entertainment
so far so good  neat to have a visual version of alexa's responses nice to see the lyrics of music you are listening to  flash briefings have good videos  speaker is much better than a dot but not the highest quality
great technology can not believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful wish i had bought another one
love love this new little gadget  has  made our lives so much easier  it is like having our own personal secretary living here in the home  we hardly need our cd's anymore since alexa plays everything we need  going to get the alexa dots soon for more rooms  thanks
like google better
easy setup and sound quality
i like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list set and alarm play any song i can think of and much more i wish the sound could be a tad louder
this was just an additional one for my other tv loved it so much use it on the regular tv easy to set up and fairly easy to navigate i do not waste my money on regular tv cable or anything else this is enough for me as i do not watch too much tv
great improvement over the original echo  like the ability to see lyrics to songs watch prime tv and get other visuals  the little hints about things to try that appears across the bottom sparks the imagination
i have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom it was even easier to set up than my original echo
love the feature to play music in every room with multiple echos
i was able to use this in another room and add alexa in that room
works replaced my expired bedside radio alarmit took me a while to realize that option setting involved using it as a touch screenmaybe it should said something during the setup process
setting up
barry
it is so efficient and amazing  how cool  we all use it often every day
this product is easy to use and very entertaining  i have yet to hook it up to my tv or lights but look forward to doing so
good as new
alexa us funny and enjoyable nice sound
sounds great love them
i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best i am happy to see they are making improvements with each new oneit would be great to have updates to our little ai's i think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it all in all i am very happy with her and i can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble thank you
i use this product for enjoyment and i just love it
love it it is so handy and easy to use got it for my classroom but i many need to just get another one
love alexa  i own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit
very easy set up really enjoying it
this is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock  i use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video  audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video  much of the time it works well as alarm clock but there are some serious flaws particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake  it does not seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules  try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying alexa set an alarm for 5am and then having alexa repeat ok alarm set for 5am  not good  i suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid  plain and simple this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm  i know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone  no thanks if i am picking up my phone to set an alarm i will just use its built in alarm and save a step  at least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse  the interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great  there should be separate snooze and cancel buttons  currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels  it is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled  when the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while i am in the shower
i like the fact that the messages are visual now as well as audiblei am puzzled because it will light up and make the &quotnotification&quot sound but when i ask alexa to read my notifications she tells me that there are no new notifications  this has happened at least once a day for over a week now
i was skeptical at first but it grows on you  it looks good so far  i did however turn off the camera
alexa hardly came on
i like being able to tell alexia the music i want to hear but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if i am not very specific about the title
love this thing works great and kids love it to
i love this thing i talk to it through walls and in other rooms i have been an amazon lover for a while so i have amazon music unlimited kindle unlimited prime video etc so i was ready for this when it came out the screen is just so nice to havethe only thing resembling a down side is that it does not always perfectly understand which song i want to hear but i do have a deep southern accent lower alabama so i do not speak english anyways
we were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features how nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command looking forward to exploring other options with this device
we are so glad that we got the echo over a bluetooth speaker alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there i personally love the timer feature it has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously pandora integration is another feature that i use daily so happy with out prime day purchase i will get the echo hub and a few more echo dots in the future
i really like it 
this echo dot is horrible the volume on my phone is louder than than this device my boss has one at this is not the case
very impressed with look clarity of sound and color
i am really enjoying the many different features on my alexa especially listening to music and audio books
i love that i can shut the microphone off at night so my children can not talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music not sure how i survived with out this for so long
my three year old loves it  good for doing basic household tasks  we are going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs
i have been waiting for prime day to purchase an echo plus and now i am enjoying learning what alexa can do with a new sonos one and an echo dot i have the makings of a really nice and well integrated smart home love it
second dot
we like it very convenient
i bought 2 of these plus 2 echo dot 2nd generation on prime days love the echo plus easy to setup the reason for the 4 star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free philips hue white a19 single led bulb works with amazon alexa there is no one to call to find out why
i got a second unit for the bedroom i was expecting the sounds to be improved but i didnt really see a difference at all  overall not a big improvement over the 1st generation
i really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens i have no complaints at this time
makes accessing all of the apps easy love the voice control
very easy to set up and straight forward directions loads fast also
the installation and connection to my wi fi was so easy getting the amazon prime and netflix going was a breeze i have not used a voice remote before that was amazing yes i am old school i will be reviewing more features and options as i have time but i am very excited to own such a product that lives up to the all the great things i have read and heard
loved it till someone stoled it can not afford to replace it yet but i am going too
still getting used to alexa but i think she's a keeper
i received the echo in perfect condition the device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues alexa is a great addition to our family
handy if you do not expect much out of it much dumber than the assistant in my phone
 
we have five of them need i say more
very good option
it is easy to set up and use there are new features and skills added all the time
love my fire stick and remote so easy to set up and use endless amounts of apps to download used it with my smart tv and it is 100x better than the features smart tvs offer
great product
this is our third echo worth every penny it is like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate we keep them in the bedrooms and the living room we can drop in and use them as an intercom listen to music answer quick questions alarms to wake up for school etc
we love this thing i wish i would have gotten it sooner you will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework there are loads of skills i am very happy with this purchase especially since i got it on prime day for almost half price
i like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list set and alarm play any song i can think of and much more i wish the sound could be a tad louder
loving this way more than google home devices i have been using for a couple months and if you're an amazon prime subscriber the value here is greater than google i am using to listen to free music with prime better than alternatives audible and you can even watch movies the display is a little small for lots of watching the sound should be louder and youtube needs to be available these issues put this at a 35 to 4 stars fix one of them youtube and its a 5 star item to alleviate sound i have paired with a blue tooth speaker right now this sits in my living area where i think it will shine is my office desk once there are great offers i could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other amazon alexa items for my household i felt happy after adding this to my house where as i felt stupid using google home
great  love it
like it to do more
the second one which was a refurbished model did work at least not in my home
got it for the smart hub and does exactly was it says turn lights on and off arm and disarm my security system and the thermostat is next  greatproduct
works great
easy to use answers all my questionshands free what is not to like  it may not be perfect but it is  a sign of the times to come can be connected to smart home items i enjoy it totallly keeps your home connected
this firestick is everything
very satisfied with the purchase the package came in good time and was just as expected
this thing is a lot cooler than i thought it would be  i mostly have used it to read me audiobooks but i also love that i can see into the camera while i am at work
it was easy to set up and affordable love it
my  wife & i enjoy the ease of playing our music the games are fun & entertaining i look forward to adding more smart products to my home
i was a little apprehensive about buying this because i saw reviews saying it sounds like crap i am no audiophile by any means so maybe it is that but i think it sounds great considering the size it fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear i have not had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands i have it paired to an ecobee3 my firestick and a phillip's hue light bulb i plan on adding devices as i go i love this thing and i am glad i scooped it up i have only had it around 2 weeks will update if i run into issues
i love how fast you get a respond from alexaalso easy to find any thing you are looking forjust speak in to the remote
how did i live this long without the echo  you get to enjoy any music style  just my asking alexa  going to up greade to the wireless  love the echo  love you too alexa 
fantastic product i use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program
bought this to replace a sony dash remember those after sony decided to pull support from it entirely it works great for what i use it for an alarm clock a weather station background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house my biggest gripe about the device and why i knocked a star off is that you can not turn off the suggestions on things to try it 's an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you do not want to see as it cycles through content screens a software update or two would help this improve especially full control of what we want and do not want to see in the content rotation
works just fine
it is better than the 1st gen in every way except for one  i really miss the ring at the top for volume control  it was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the   one and press it a few times  i also wish the bass was a bit better  all in all it is a great device and i am happy with it
really like the show me feature i also like video calls with others
i replaced my 1st gen was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same soundi was wrong  if anything it is the same volume and more clear  good product
gift for my man he does not like that you have to plug it in and the pictures do not show the cord would prefer it cordless still works though for the purpose we bought it
works great
awesome device wish i bought one ages ago
i was really happy with my original echo so i thought i would get an echo dot to use in my bedroom i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi presumably due to interference from the bluetooth then  i connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack when i did that the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound im hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device
really happy with this purchase  great speaker and easy to set up
bought the 2nd firestick for bedroom easily installed and set up works great
i sent it to my 85 year old dad and he talks to it constantly
cheap and cheap sound
i live this item  i bought several for each room in the house and as a gift for my mom  i also use mine to travel with
love it it is number 4
love it
purchased this for a discount on prime day to insert into a portable bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with echo dot works great love it now i can bring alexa out onto the patio with me and i mostly use it for music this is our 3rd echo product and we love them
love it i was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered i could not pass it up it is fun to ask alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from amazon prime music you can also connect your iphone with bluetooth and play music with pandora or youtube videos using alexa as a speaker i have been having fun asking alexa different types of questions or for information like weather news or even the time in other countries the only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan because alexa uses burns it up when playing music
so far it seems to be a very nice item it picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems the other day i asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine i have only used it to listen to music and check the weather but it has done both of those things very well
i bought this fire stick for another tv no more arguments about what to watch
i had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home my wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer this has been a godsend 100% we have the amazon music for her and now she can listen to music check the weather get phone numbers make calls etc etc we are still learning but i tell you this is absolutely amazing i purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on alexa with the wifi and direct cable capability the speaker stereo options are there for the choosing this is well worth the money you won't regret this at all
although i have not taken advantage of many of the echo's features there is one that bothers me it starts talking even when i have not said anything even close to the wake up word   echo   had to change from alexa due to a conflict with another device
easy to connect and the skills created for our echo 2nd gen worked fine with the dot
the echo plus is great so easy to set up and with the built in hub it connects to other alexa devices with a mere verbal command i am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me have my lights integrated with alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks definitely recommend the echo plus
worked as advertised 
this thing is awesome  i got it on prime day for a great deal  i wish i had purchased two  i also bought the echo show version but the sound is not nearly as good as the echo plus  the echo show came dented so i will be exchanging it  i like the screen and many of the features so i will not be getting a refund  it was still worth the price
bought two of these one for my kitchen and the other for my sewing room its great if i need a recipe or need to know how to do something  i am still learning everything it can do
pleased with the order just what i wanted
works better than i thought
alexa is not as smart as siri cannot cancel snooze after alarm goes off have to cancel pre set alarm for weekdays
we are loving ours very much
i am a hardcore fan of echo infact i am in love with all members of my alexa family i have echo echo dot echo plus and now this new toddler echo spot every variant has its own beauty i love feel and size of echo spot it is fabulous as far as looks are concerned it does not have great audio quality which i did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size i bought it to connect with my bose soundtouch
this is my third dot they all work perfectly and i use each one multiple times a day absolutely love them
works absolutely great
fun taking to the tv works good it is a little confusing moving around the programs
does not work all the time
alexa is the best smart speaker out there i am so glad i came across it the sound is so amazing and i mostly use amazon alexa for music and school work help i love to control my room lights and the color totally recommend
perfect for streaming our shows ditched cable and we are in love
👍🏻
alarm calendar reminders
i was pleasantly surprised it is awesome so far
a helpful product with a few glitches eg inability to occasionally access all flash briefing stations and understand or answer certain questions but amazon will likely fix and improve it
really like it
love it can not stop using it
device is touted as able to link to calendar on my samsung phone through google can not get it to work
easy to set up and use
has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands
got this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event it sounds pretty good and works well so far
easy installation and set up better sound from the echo dot smart speaker very satisified with purchase
good size screen and gets good range for voice commands sometimes it picks up weird commands when i am watching tv though great product for the price if you do not need the big show screen
ordered 2 on deal day 1 does not work and 2 nd just went down after 2 days 😏
i got this for dad on father's day  he was tickled with it
being able to tell it what to go to
good device
great prime day buy
like it but it will take time to setup all the skills i want simply because there are so many i already use music and flash briefing daily very satisfied i use this along with alexa app on my kindle hd8
took a little work to set up but i finally got it  sound quality not the best but for what i got it for it works great  i check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it  i do play the radio on it when i want some music but will probably upgrade to the echo plus for better sound
you're going to have to shell out an extra $20 bucks for the stand that should come with it so you can angle it best for how ever you are using this my biggest gripe i already spent an arm and a leg on this it should come with the stand
small convenient and dependable this dot is a cutie and alexa does the job you askmy only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker
we love the fire tv stick and will love it even more when we sever our cable connection when our service agreement expires
music weather time
did take me about 6 hours to set it up i have a galaxy s9 phone when i got used to the system setup it was in seconds edit my light bulbs adding a string of lights simple easy
it is easier to do things with it
i love itshe is very helpful i use her for remembering things and sleep you can ask her just about anything i have only had her for about a week so still learning her
the speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly
get this in white i bought it for my girlfriend in white and i wish i had it in white now alexa is one of those devices you will always use and miss when it is not around i find new uses for alexa every day i have incorporated this device into so many parts of my daily life as alexa learns more i learn more she's my alarm clock she reminds me of important dates i am constantly asking her for information like travel entertainment science history politics etc she turns on and off lights she's the core of my smart home
just like the other one
it does so much more than i knew when i bought it it pretty much runs my house helps me fall asleep takes care of my schedule and entertainment
i bought this specifically for the smart hub capability so far it has been great easy set up instructions for all the various brands compatible with it
great
easy to set up still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug grandkids think alex is cool
love this thing people think i am crazy for paying this much for a glorified alarm clock but i do not care for me waking up in a good mood is pretty important and this helps me do it so glad i do not have to deal with my old eeaanh eeaanh eeaanh alarm very excited to say alexa turn off the lights smart plugs get here soon got a camera privacy slide for this since it is in my bedroom
very easy to set up great sound
love it except that amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual i do not have hours to research websites plus more instruction from alexa on skills would be great we often get the answer i do not know that skill even though i have added it in the app ie kwikset or pizza hut
we are still in the discovery phase but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed
simple install and love the voice activation
bought for my bathroom to listen when i am in the shower  love it
great product
love it
works great some of the apps will start buffering but it is probably my internet love the alexa voice control
i loved the i can use voice to make a request i use it for music and movies
i like the design and the visuals
i returnef this item because it does not speak spanish
alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development speech recognition fails to understand basic american and british accentthe music it can play is very restrictive speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a almost a human is speaking linking to youtube via amazon web services does not work
ease of use and many tasks it will perform
loved it
it is great but sound quality is very low
i am very excited and happy with this it was a breeze to set up and my favorite feature is reading my kindle and going to sleep to thunderstorm music
the sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions
we originally got the show to video chat family members and it works great for that we have found that we really like checking things hands free like the weather and recipes so far we have really liked the show and would recommend it
i jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an echo  i feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later the device is sharing news and weather  now we use it some but have not tapped in to all options  still testing it out
so  convenient  i will never touch the remote again to shut off my tv
im able to connect to prime quick
i love it
i like how easy it was to set up very easy to use and set up with other bluetooth devices
have alexa throughout the house    the future has arrived
love my new alexa she works great so far
alexa is a decent speaker if that's all you need she is terrible at most other things she consistently answers questions that were not asked or says hmmm i do not know that for everything else we have gone back to just using our phones because she can not really look anything up pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when i had an awesome bose bluetooth already i bought her because my mother who lives alone uses hers a lot and is happy with it but we have a full house with kids and i am less than impressed i would never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall
echo is good
we are still discovering all that the echo can do
love the light bulb feature
i love the sound quality of this unit it is a very clear sound
very easy to hook up download the app and it walks you through the setup
i love everything about it i love that the echo plus turns on and off my light it can also dim them with voice commands i also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that i did not purchased  audibles for i like that it can play my music from amazon music pandora tunein i heart radio and spotify echo can even play my local radio station i love that the echo is connected to my tivo bolt this allows tivo to pause stop and play whatever i want with a simple voice command i love that i can reorder items that i purchased on amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered  the only three dislikes that i have is that if you’re up too close or to far the echo does not respond so i think they need to improve the microphone and i wish the speaker was better the speakers are okay but could be improved also i have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet well the other day i received a red light right on my echo plus this error was sorry i am having trouble understanding you please try again later after research online i learned it was a problem connecting to my internet and it was easy to find this out and i found it odd that my dot wasn’t having this problem even though they are connected to the same network
does not always respond to the wake word this is my 3rd echo product and i have to say i am a little disappointed alexa voice assistant is great when it comes to controlling a connected home but has a lot to learn from google assistant when it comes to  getting answers for search queries
this is my second echo and i love how it helps me in the kitchen i can set timers listen to the news prepare grocery lists and get great music
i wanted a white dot for my white bathroom  the top is black as shown which i knew but i did not realize the cord and plug were also black i wanted a white cord and plug
love the tv movie selection i really like the fact that i can just rent a movie if they do not have it in their selection
primarily for music in our bedroom  i wish the speaker had better fidelity
stopped working after 7 months the warranty was only good for 3 months i would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months i mean what is this product supposed to be a piece of junkthey offered my a 15% discount if i wanted to buy another one why would i want to buy another one
 
i liked the sound  what is troubling is that i paid extra money to have access to a million more songs sometimes it does not work ex alexa play italian songs do not have or don t understand or play the opera tosca response sorry i dont have that
this is the worst amazon purchase i have made i am big amazon fanlove the brandunlimited digital musicprime videoseven buy my online games music and movies through amazon this app i have tried to use it make simple purchases    to do anything it is useless
love my echo great sound very smart
fun item to play with and get used to using  sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask but i think it will be better
purchased this for a discount on prime day to insert into a portable bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with echo dot works great love it now i can bring alexa out onto the patio with me and i mostly use it for music this is our 3rd echo product and we love them
i am addicted to this thing
works well with optional cameras  conferencing is good  still feel like bezos is spying on me
beyond awesome
this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered
enjoy using it  great sound  love the shopping list
small size works great in our sunroom
love it
love it  so do the grandkids
i love the echo show awesome speakers i love the fact when you listen to music the words come up all around liking it so far also being able to read what is on your shopping list to do list and notifications
simply love my echo i hardly watch any tv at all anymore i am too busy listening to music speaker is pretty goo for its size all the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family
i would like to tell you that i have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck or the color or the shape or even the way it smells but i can honestly say the number reason i hate this device is i have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail i have 4 other echo devices already that i set up and use quite regularly i have reset my phone galaxy s8 checked the app for updates i have cycled power to the echo unit with each attempt i work in the network technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here i used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and i have to force the app to close restart my phone and the echo and try again i figured 3x's was enough it shouldn't be that hard a techie i can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technologyi hope they won't call me i will tell em to send the product back
great fun but frustrating at times commands between tv and the show get mixed asking to watch something will turn my directv not display on show which stinks with an 8 year old also would like more video options with flash briefings still really a tech wonder for a low price
it is alexa what else can you say
works great
wonderful still learning how to use had a heck of a time setting it up but is happened somehow
i have had a lot of fun with this thing my 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs i control the lights and play games like categories has nice sound when playing music as well
she does not always listen
i like the built in hub plus the unit sounds great just wish it had a volume control on it
looks and performs as new  no complaints
i received the echo as a gift i needed another bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible and found this smart speaker can not wait to see what else it can do
great product and i would give 5 stars   but you can not scroll face cards without having the stupid try and ask alexa suggestions pop up  yes you can have it scroll once and just stay on the clock but i like having other cards as well god its the worst and so irritating  i got it super cheap so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a dot instead of a spot  what a dumb move on amazons​ part
love my echo great sound very smart
very amazing product great sound quality
love it perfect for an alarm clock replacement plus so much more
listen music and set timer
as of nowi love everything about it
this is our first step into a smart home soon as i added one item to the grocery list i started loving it my wife was so so about it ‘til i opened rain sounds she’s a convert 😉 love these and the dots
small speaker tin sound great with good bluetooth speaker
great sound and the screen is nice to actually see time trivia etc
i have not had my show very long or used it a lot but i love it i use it to set timers when cooking because my stove is being finicky and not wanting to work most of the time i also use it to check for different recipes listen to music and my all time favorite telling everyone it is time for dinner my son gets a real kick out of thati know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment but remember the original echo did not have what it has now when it first came out i see that amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon i am sure it will have all that we want very soon maybe even things we have not thought ofi do wish it was a bit more user friendly i still have not figured out how to video chat with my cousin in north carolina who also has one and when i tried to call my son's dot it went to video chat immediately last i looked dots do not have video screensanother thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill i had enabled that was free so now he is a bit worried to use it again that needs to be fixedi do have to say that all in all i am very happy with my echo show
love it  now if i can only find the correct smart linksplug to connect this too
i like the hands free operation vs the tap we use both for controlling smart plugs
works greathaving fun playing musicchecking weathera king questions
item as described and delivered on time  thank you
3rd dot love it
 
 
the best thing since sliced bread
seems to be a good product but unable to play music in sync with my sonos system sonos does not seem to recognize it at all
purchased as a gift
😄😄
easy set up
great device responsive and helpful
excellent
easy to set up lots of things to watch and program in  have not even gotten that far into it yet  easy to use highly recommended  leaning more and more closer to cutting the cable cord for good
the echo spot is great
great love it
awesome life changer seriously i am able to start my morning with alexa by having her wakeme up with  her alarm and then playing me some music she has gotten used to my voice that i can be in another room and she will listen to what i say i love both my echos do not hesitate get one and for the price the speaker is unbelievable i am buying the cordless holder so i can take the echo anywhere love my purchase and love alexa
fast response which was amazing  clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic  i am still getting used to alexia and have not usde echo to its full extent
great product at a great price
still trying to link to my son's and daughter's in their rooms
i love it
working great this far  can not tell it is not new  will edit for longevity in a year that's the real test
has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands
absolutely love it
i got this for my husband on prime day he loves it as his alarm clock and smart device this is our 3rd echo device and we have them all connected throughout the house although you can deactivate the camera we also chose to cover it since the device is in our bedroom i am not comfortable with having a camera in the room no we do not bring our cell phones in the room
very convenient
the echo does not link to direct tv even though they said it would i have spent multiple hours on this made phone calls and texts also is missing free bulb
not all that happy the speaker isn’t great and for some reason a lot of times when i play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop my son has a google home and it is much better
got to love alexa she does everything around our house
it does everything that it offers
a small problem out of the box but a rep from amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues i was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made including follow up email to get this thing working i have 6 now and one google clone and the more i use it and learn about it the more i like it them i also plan to install one in my car boat and garage alexa is my new best friend loli think gf is worried that if alexa learns to cook her time will be limited
ight
love this thing works great and kids love it to
small footprint  nice clarity
excellent product 
this is my 3rd echo and with the built in hub it works great   now i have an echo in the family room my bedroom and my home office
great product sometimes alexa does not understand some commands for my fire tv all in all this is a fabulous speaker
this product is amazing i love it best buy only thing missing is bluetooth
this is a great product  set up was easy  sound is wonderful
glad i bought this
really disappointed alexa has to be plug in to wall socket all the time  my fault for not checking this but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery  if i could return it i would as my apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the alexa
love it love it love it bought it on prime day then had buyers remorse but once i got it it was love at first sight
i love all the viewing choices on fire stick
this small echo dot is amazing the sounds that come out are greatit changes my nest thermostatand my phillips hue lightswithout leaving my chair
love the fire stick i can download watch great movies instead of searching i use alexa voice  prime does not offer very many newer movies is the only negativei also wished there was a way you could set it up to post newest movies first
sounds great love them
none
verygod
still learning all the capabilities but so far pretty pretty pretty good
just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it
just like new set up was quick & easy
love it love it
use as my 3rd dot bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and does not have access to phone
love this little dot with a screen  super easy to set up and easy to use  instantly connected to all my other echo products  i also bought the screen cover that has the blocking button for the camera if you want to use it  recommended
i dislike that it confuses my requests all the time
overall good device it was bought for a workout room and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine it could use a much better speaker
i really have not found any difference between this and the original version i bought they both work great
hands free calling in the house i misplace my cell phone all the time so this is a real blessing really enjoying the streaming music
great speaker with a lot of capabilities very fun to learn how to use it
like all types of funmusic and more
love my echo still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun
very easy to set up works wonderful and i love it
very easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone
love it so easy to use
is good
really like it the screen is a major plus
its was easy to set up
best streaming device on the market i now own 3
it has a nice speaker
she's [alexa] a bit dense and still learning the way i phrase things with my ny nj regional accent
it was a gift and the recipient love love loves it love kiss kiss kiss kiss heart
i love my echo plus and have cousins from italy here visiting and they love it  i want to give them each one however will it work for them in italy someone please answer my question asap
great price works perfectly saved the money on a refurb would buy again
like it alots something different than traditional television the use of alexa is nice too
i love this device i upgraded from the echo spot i just wish i could customize the clock on my screen to analog to mimic what i was used to in the echo spot also there is better sound quality on this device
i love this technology i am older but this is so easy to set up and use i have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything i use my echo for which is in the living room
we all love her
love it so glad we got it on prime day although now having it i would totally pay full price for it
i love it
love
great to have along with the echo
the first one quit working shortly after i got it the next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app i am not sure if it just this dot or they are all this way
good sound works well
it was perfect
it is fantastic
love it    have one inside house and one by our pool now  just as good as bose speakers around house  
i own two dots a tap and a show i love the echo show sound quality is amazing compared to the dots i use mine constantly to create shopping list kitchen and laundry timer and news updates but most of all i have the all throughout the house and i play music throughout using the group settings
this is our 2nd one and we love it
love the product nice to have easy access to so much info
wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item
i have an original echo and really like it i wanted another one for my basement i realize it isn't a huge stereo with settings but it does not sound bad at all definitely does not take up much room great price for the echo plus on prime day i ordered two
good device
how easy if was to set up
prime video
i live alone this is the best companion
so far so good
great interface  i enjoy the voice remote
love the product nice to have easy access to so much info
do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either  it rarely gets what i say correct does not control the dish receiver  yes i set it up correctly using the alexa app on my phone  we got this for 129  which is a good deal ti is definately not worth the 229 price though  maybe in another month it will get better or either i have one that is just deaf and dumb  really can not recommend this item at the current time
ideal when you have amazon prime my very first fire tv stick i should have purchased one a long time ago i wish i bought 2 or 3 on amazon prime day and not to forget the fantastic alexa features
does everything as expected and more
first time using alexa and so far i love it
great product fun to use
ease of use
love it
love it
i loved it so much on my living room tv that i bought one for the bedroom tv highly recommend this device to anyone wanting to simplify and improve their online entertainment experience
great buy at $20
love this just wish it had a built in hub
well i am a big fan of echoes these ones went i am my bathrooms  works just great as expected 👍🏾
we really only use this as a speaker to stream music we have had it 7 months and it is just kinda useless
as a user of chromecast for years i have to say that the firestick is a nice upgrade i really like that i can download all the apps for different media sources like hbo showtime etc that i have free access to from my cable account but with the firestick i get a better picture and can go directly to the shows i want to see the downside was the time it took to download all the apps and set them up but the good thing is that the setup is a onetime procedure
easy to set up
i bought this to replace a dot in my living room speaker is slightly better it hears me better over the tv unfortunately it does not understand or respond to my requests as well as the dot i frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what i want the dot usually does exactly what i want on the first request i do not consider it an upgrade
love my spot
easy to install very clear speaker i took one star off because it was delivered late by ontrac like usual
exactly like new can tell the difference from my new dot i got prior to this one works perfectly love alexa
i am leaving this for those who do not have enough of an attention span to read instructions  you can stop the screen rotationsswipe down on clock screenselect settingshome & clockhome cardsrotate onceproblem solved
its ok my home screen on my fire stick is not working on my television so by that not workingalexa will not respond to any questions or commandsi am going to reach out to amazon this weekend
i bought this to replace a dot in my bedroom already have a show and a couple of full sized echo units in my housethe spot is okay for what it is two issues one minor and one major the minor one   why include the huge bezel on the front why not take that space and make the display larger a total waste of usable space the major one also involves the show i am very used to these devices i do not need to see things to try whenever i use a voice command with it even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices i am not a child and i do not need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it and having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed why does not amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off i want to see a clock face period not these silly nanny reminders
i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo i would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker oh well it is what it is and i still love it i am just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but does not take up a whole lot of space
i just think that it is to darn confusing and there are parts that i would try and just wouldn't work i just do not like it not what i thought it would be
never buy certified and refurbished echo dot  i bought a certified and refurbished  echo dot this unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command never buy a refurbished echo dot the unit i received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated i also bought a new echo dot it works perfectlyvery disappointed 
totally clear picture with numerous channels available used for my kitchen tv
works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished
i like that it respond most of my comands great product
fun to interact with
works great in my large open room
you’re all i needna na nana
never could get it to work a techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter was not strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store so i am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then
liked 100%
as expected
so far i love it  it was easy to set up   if i can do it anybody can  speakers are great and its fun to play my music with just a voice command
works great
it is awesome
the fire stick has been amazing easy  setup and easy to use an awesome deal on prime day
this is my first smart device and i will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one
device was not working followed all instructions for alexa echo dot and it did not come on very upsetting
i have had all good experience so far with the second generation echo there are so many more things to learn but i have not had the time yet right now i am mostly enjoying the music weather updates using the alarm feature and her personality i have also purchased some mini smart socket yes i am very excited to begin using them
love our fire stickeasy to set up and have loads of shows for free and plenty to rent or buywe also use pluto tv and tubi so that's even more tvalexa makes it so easy to find any show or movie i wantwe love the money we save
good product
best streaming device i have used in 5 years just wish the remote had a headphone jack like the roku remote does
good product i like it  thank you 
i love it it is just what i thought it would be  i am addicted
alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time
neat tool we enjoy it with the family
works good
unit is working great but it is a true pia that products today are shipped without user manuals do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased i have no idea of the echo show's capabilities i have it linked to my hue lights but have no idea what commands will work and what won't i purchased a fire tv stick along with the show but have no idea how to maximize the two just a few examplesi even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful seems way too basic to me but better than a kick in the pants
we love alexa we use her to play music play radio through itunes play podcasts through anypod and set reminders we listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning we rely on our custom lists we like being able to voice control the volume we are sure we will continue to find new usessometimes it is a bit frustrating when alexa does not understand what we are saying
great addition to my alexa base using it in my guest bedroom for music clock and infodot speaker is not as strong as the base but it is a great value
overall love it there are just some commands which aren't effective it may be part user error or alexa becoming accustom to what is being asked
 
the echo plus is very straight forward and easy to use  it plays great sounding music and can do lots of other things  still learning what all it can do  working very well so far
i wanted to see my security video cameras without having to use my phone works great and extremely easy to set up
great technology can not believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful wish i had bought another one
love itjust like the other 4 i own
we held off purchasing an echo but could not resist during prime days  the echo works great and it is nice to have the screen  there is still a lot more we need to learn how to do
sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it does not respond or you forget the correct command  alexa turn on the living room lights  oops i mean alexa turn on the family room lights i also never realized i call my couch a sofa some times  unfortunately my alexa is confused by my changing names for where i sit
great sound and video
received the wrong productwas so excited to install it all excitement gone thank you amazon
a great productonce we learned how to work itthis thing is awesome
i think i now have 5 of these throughout the house so convenient to set a timer or check the weather or whatever wherever
bought this for the guest room  it is a radio alarm clock information​ center and so much more
love it
this  is my second echo to purchase    the price was so cheap    i am seriously thinking of buying 2 more    i use alexa for everything    it is the next best thing to the internet   
i will never buy anything amazon makes againthis fire stick is not even a year old and it does nothing but restart and freeze up constantly no warranty from amazon in this should have been my first clue that it was a horrible device i will never buy anything built by amazon again
works well pictures awesome sound could be better must be on the same bandwidth as other alexa devices for whole home music 24ghz vs 5ghz
works great bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house
is working like a  new one for now l have another 3 alexa devices lm a fanatic
i have not figured out how to make or receive calls  device tells me i need to register and i do not know what to do
did t really know what i could use this device for used it for a few things but need an overview
this is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better thank you
daughter wanted a white boombox nothing good out for 11 yr old  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white bt good speaker  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet
it is alright
bought this for our son as his birthday present and he loves it  often find him jamming to music in his room now    he loves the options for the alarms and we have his weekday alarms set to repeat and he gets to sleep in on non school days
great product sometimes alexa does not understand some commands for my fire tv all in all this is a fabulous speaker
love it many stations to choose from
i am an echo fan but this one did not work
alexa is awesome the first day i got my echo plus i found out things that she can do that i did not think were even possible i highly recommend this product along with all the accessories
totally gets out sense of humour
i am spoiled by one downstairsso got this one for upstairs to listen to music  etc while i walked on the treadmill
my 3rd echo device very easy to set up works perfectly
i have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it i set morning alarms check the weather have alexa play various music i bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound and i am learning her skills a little tricky to connect to wifi initially but after some trial and error it connected and has stayed connected so far super satisfied will be buying one for my mother and one for my office
love it i have listened to songs i have not heard since childhood i get the news weather information it is great
i purchased the echo plus with built in hub during prime days sale it was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my wifi also connected it to a smart plug to control a light i love telling alexa to play music and she hears me from 2 rooms away excited to learn new uses for it
very capable  language recognition is the best i have experienced  great sound too
love love love
we are loving ours very much
i have had an alexa dot for some time but i am really enjoying the alexa show it is great to have a visual whether it is a song or the weather played jeapordy but i am not good at it you do learn trivia and no one's watching love that recipes are visible and movies are available have not had it long enough to try everything
almost like having star trek in your home  fun to try and outsmart
 
best thing i have invested in in a while thank you so much happy happy happy happy
it get on sale after 2 days so  check events before u buy these amazon products
love my echo dot easy to use and set up
love it
nothing to dislike i love my new toy that has made my house a smart home
great
my husband likes being able to use it to listen to music  i wish we knew all it is capabilities
best father's day gift dad joked to my mom that alexa will be the one listening to all of his repeated stories going forward
this used dot works fine it compliments my echo
weak sound compared to the google home mini the sound is bad also you need prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both i think it is lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices
got it and as expected its great almost a swell as my show
didnt think id get an alexa device but this is perfect for my home office  the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other alexa devices  it can show lyrics of songs play my xm radio can show videos of movie trailers and news  its great
like all types of funmusic and more
it works
it looked brand nrw i have nothing tocomplain about i will defently be ordering more
for a refurbished item it works like its new which i love easy set up  which i love the only issue is the volume  if you are listening while relaxing its fine  but if you are expecting to do anything else  i recommend  purchasing a speaker
see subject line  love it
the echo spot has really helped me to streamline my day and be more efficient it reminds me of any appointments warns me about traffic snarls and tells me the weather every day while suggesting new music and introducing me to new artists
almost as good as my bose love the whole house music
this item did not work certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised instead this item crashed as soon as i turned it on and plugged it in when trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot it crashed over and over not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light alexa would tell me it is ready to connect and freeze mid sentence tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it did not do anything returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it
gift for husband  great
neat tool we enjoy it with the family
very intrusive so i turn it off
i have two one in my computer room and the other that i move around out on the deck not great for watching video but it can be done with the added sound you do not get from the echo dot it is perfect for the location i have it in add whole house music and you have just arrived in nervana
we love this
just like any other echo does not disappoint
i love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices
best thing i have ever owned started with the dot and now added the spot and i love iy
wish there were more skills
this product is a complete waste of money when you ask alexa a question she either does not know the answer gives you the wrong answer or finds information off of wikipedia
used twice not working
i love it it does everything
fantastic product absolutely love it
excellent product set up with ease as well
the sound is wonderful and it just plain works i wish it cost less but it is worth the cost especially on prime day
absolutely love this product so easy to use better than scrolling channels
it is just not as loud as i thought it was going to be
cord cutting
i love having an alexa
love my spot have that  a dot and a regular echo
bought for my wife she loves it
i am not super impressed with alexa when my prime lapsed she wouldn't play anything she isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can not use it for that either she randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her just today i unplugged hernot sure i will ever use my alexa again
having so much fun with alexa love being able to listen to music when i am across the room or busy doing something else
good sound the capacity of join different apps to make work your smart home
purchased this on prime day and i absolutely love it  i had the echo dot on my nightstand but i really missed a display this is perfect and the speakers are excellent
there was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep i spoke with could fix the replacement was registered to someone else when the price of the dot went down to $3999 same price as the refurbished ones i bought a brand spanking new one no problem with the new one
i love it bought one for my daughter and one for myself
thank you great product
i have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a philip hue bulb  the excited ended quickly  i spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my alexa echo plus  everything i tried ended in a discovery failed message  i tried to set this up over and over and over again  i watched youtube videos  i read set up websites  i was the poster child of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different resultsthe next day i went onto amazon to get the tech support  i was hoping something would be done to make this thing work but also the problem not being operator error  well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr and 19 mins of being on the phone it still did not work  this product has tested my patience  so far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old schoolthe only reason i gave this two stars is because amazon will be sending me a different echo plus and light bulb  the problem was not the bulb because before packing up the items i purchased another bulb and still alexa could not locate this devicei pray the next attempt is successful and then i will revise this rating but what are the odds that i was shipped a defective echo  the support person had the same thought  maybe i should be exploring the google device but i can not get over the look of that hub  it looks like a defuseri can not believe i did not find youtube videos that show the problems i did  everything looked simple and seamlessnot the experience i had  ok i am done with this review because i spend enough wasted time this weekend already
easy set up works perfect
love it i play music everyday and voice  activated makes it so easy
i bought this for my mother and she loves it i want to get one for myself now
as described and received on time  do not like automatic enrolment into music
i love having an alexa
super easy to hook up and program i use the music feature the most but i love how i can set reminders from my phone and my echo will remind me at the set time it is great for my news updates too
its okay but keeps dropping wifi
clear screen and great picture
great to play music throughout the house great and easily fits in my decor of my home
 
works like a charm
i love it
whats not to like about this speaker  just ask alexa
this thing is way cool  you should get one  if you want to be cool that is
love it
we love the size of the 2nd generation echo still needs a little improvement on sound
already had an echo dot the echo is even better with fuller sound also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great
these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house lol we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs
the amazon alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen
love it works great making my home a smarthome
i was hoping the cord was white also otherwise it is fine
it seems to be ok but the instructions are weak and i can not seem to get it to work i am going to get my techy friend to help me out and i will update you later
so far so good just got it and i am trying to figure out all the things it can do the product itself is very well made and easy to set up
love it
does not work with my fairly new smart tv but that's mainly the tv manufacturerslg fault due to not supporting anything older than tvs from this year my smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well speakers sound great and works very well
happy with this as i was with the other 2 i ordered
bought it for my mother
now i am weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them   heard about this happening on the news  i have 3 4 so this is very concerning  i wish amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this  if they have i have not heard about it yet
second dot
so far it is been very useful trying to learn all the ways to use alexa 
i bought this for my 90 year old grandmother and she and i love it she can call all her family members with just her voice play games even watch a video and i love that i can drop in on her any time to see how she is doing she lives all by herself and i feel comfortable if there was an emergency she could call out to alexa for help
does everything i could ask and more great product
just getting started with the fire tv stick so far so good
its was easy to set up
love
fire hd does so much more  over priced pair of speakers
such a fun easy and convenient device to have around the house no need to pick up my phone to look something up just a few words and the world is at your fingertips the speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp the price is right for a device like this
the fact that she can help me find my phone when i am at home alone is worth the price of this device
love it and how easy it is to use one of the best prime day purchases we have made
the sound quality wasn’t great but it was inexpensive
good smart home gadget
i am a fan of echo devices i think it is a great alternative to a clean clock i like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep my two year old sleeps so much better with it on we also use it to tell my two year old stories only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night
great product  like the apps that i can connect to it
this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered
i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo if you are a big fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regrets with this purchase it is great for technically changes people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use  if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj you can even have conversations with the echo i am not embarrassed to say that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke it tells me where my packages are since i am an amazon prime addict it comes in extremely  handy
just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it
i like everything about it 
speaker is better than 1st generation echo
 
after only a couple of days alexa did not answer i have disconnected and will see if it does any better after reconnecting
love my dots  easy to use  i have two plus the echo spot  one of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music  amazon iheart radio pandora
excellent product and service  very easy to install and my daughter is very happy
this product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable1 there is a card on the homescreen called things to try    it is an ad for other alexa services you can try you can turn off all the other homescreen cards but not this one2 by default the homescreen cards cycle automatically which is incredibly annoying there is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only cycle once instead of cycle continuously but critically this setting does not work my unit has been set to cycle once and the cards still continue to cycle all the time have rebooted the device re set etc etcuntil these two obvious software issues are fixed in my opinion the product is useless
we absolutely love this product wish we would have bought this instead of the dots
works amazing i love how you can download almost anything some apps i could not download on my apple tv but i was able too on here
the thing i like most about my echo spot is the voice command feature  you can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the echo easy to use
love this so glad i purchased
i have been through 4 shows now  and all of them have been broken  it has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders  i do not have these issues on my dot or my echo  just on the show  it would be nice if amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing
i really like the echo dot it is amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot
everything
cool
dislike the volume it does not sound loud enough
i like the fact that i can get any kind of music from prime that i want on request from alexa i liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your tv etc to the commands from alexa but i really love having the music
have only had it set up for a few days still adding smart home devices to it the speaker is great for playing music i like the size we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it is not intrusive to look at
its great lots of fun
what can i say well i am a  paranoid it person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control so yes i love my echo stuff but i did create a isolated vlan on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app be carful with these people  entering your wi fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing try to stay with devices that  work directly with the alexa hub with no third party app amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled
terrific
it is awesome
it won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tvit connects but won’t work
great product fast shipping
small convenient and dependable this dot is a cutie and alexa does the job you askmy only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker
absolutely an amazing device very easy to setup and use
not impressed
i bought an echo dot that had been refurbished but its stops whatever function its performing quite often does not wake up every time randomly turns on but does nothing do not buy a refurbished echo dot
having received this as a gift i am writing my initial thoughts compared to my google home minipros  way easier to setup than the google home mini  i was able to connect all of my smart home device unlike google without any issues  making phone calls on this was clearer for the receiver to understand mecons  need to enable 'skills' to get more functionality  google home has built in functionality to search the web for answer to questions easier than  the amazon echo  could not connect this to youtube
the echo dot was everything that i expected and more
terrible stopped working after one day
works as promised
using it to stream amazon prime and netflix
it every ting i thought it would be plus more  this will be going to my mom right after i get through playing with it
as advertised  connected my smart bulbs with no problems
entertainment
so far alli can say is i love it
very easy to install  very intuitive to use  very happy with the purchase
wish i bought one for work too
love my echo still learning all the things it will do wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package but found a great one on u tube
review
exceeded my expectations
weak sound compared to the google home mini the sound is bad also you need prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both i think it is lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices
nice product a+
all of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account asking any echo device to play music on sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly this went on for two weeks until i eventually solved the problem that neither amazon nor sonos could figure out
i love being able to have alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up
love it
very helpful for playing music setting alarms and talking to you when you are lonely
i can receive my cpr classical station  great soundwhat i like least is the learning curve and my mistakes
best price we could find and it is so useful to have her around to answer questions it is so handy to not have to find your phone i also now have an intercom system
the speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy  i bought two and the reason i only rate it a 3 is i have followed the instructions for synching music to both units  i know i have done it correctly but they won't sync  that was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units
good price prompt shipping has been working flawlessly
love it
works with blink video cameras  does not work with you tube
love our echo
love alexa these are the best thing i have ever bought do not know how i ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to
still learning all the ways to use it  it is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it  5 and 7 yrs  very cute
thanks
our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full fledged tablet  what fantastic potential these have   for digital photo screen video calls easy accesss to music audio books etc however once we have them setup we discovered the huge lurking negative  amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their alexa features  you can turn off many other things in settins but you cannot turn off things to try  instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time  we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says try   amazon please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this spam
love our little dot i do not know what the original larger alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities
works great but i do not think amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1 have prime and 2 buy an echo
it is louder than the dot and it is got a built in hub for all the other wireless controls in the house
love alexa bought others for friends
works like a champ
love that you can play music and see the lyrics  connected to my echo dot i enjoy listening in multiple rooms
i love it learning knew things with it eveyday still figuring out how everything works but so far it is been easy to use and understand she does make me laugh at times
great gadget that installs and works easily nice to not have another box taking up space too
very responsive great sound quality for its size
we like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly  you can even hear music played the speaker is clear  we are enjoying it  what we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me  the next day i asked the echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song  the echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before  it was a little disconcerting
i love it and it works great the only issue is the drop in facetime like feature sometimes lags but that could possibly be an issue with my wifi for where we have it located in the house
love the product idea super easy to set up & get started a breeze to do routine tasks set alarms timers add items to shopping to do lists play music get news just about anything it is supposed to do the sound is good where imhave it sitting not tinny at all as some have found there is one thing i hate & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone   you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask alexa unless you have her turn off the screen totally which i do when i go to bed and it is too bad bc it is like a continuously running advertisement or set up guide not attractive the echo show was on sale prior to prime day for less than the echo so i figured i was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with because of the ever present script it is not a nice device to look at i would not buy it again or recommend   go with the echo i may still exchange the product
it takes a while to learn the uses and i am still learning
i really like it 
i like it alot i connected it so i can play my pandora and i asked about the weather & time every morning i got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because i can have my music play unlimited on this i am going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once i get more comfortable with it definitely worth the money
love my echo show
great device i am cutting my cable and watching the channels i want if i want to add an app like cbs i can just pay a little extra and get it
easy setup easy use work with other smart products always learning what it can do
works well for recipes and references nice device just the right size
i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account  i think it should be part of the top line with video music etc  i also think the setup app where i define for example music i like is not well integrated into echo  i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings  i also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names which i can never rememberi like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries
it is my second one and works well
a great device
got this for the bathroom love it we can listen music whe we showering
had to return it as hulu does not work on device  it kept coming up with errors and hulu app not being able to open at times  it was hit and miss and at times hulu will stop working right in the middle of a show or movie  plus fire stick is very slow in opening the apps
so far it has been fun to use and learn how to deal with alexa i am still learning and finding out what can really be done plus i am in the process of making my house a smart house so there is no much to control with alexa yet
glad i bought this
loved the price for an essentially brand new dot opening it you really could not tell that it was refurbished everything looked brand new for $20 less than a new unit i could not consider this a better deal i really love the versatility of the echo dot get you one while you can
can not turn of things to try on the screen scroll this  is a big promotion device for amazon  packing it up and sending it back  they really want to get in our heads  enough already
the sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions
great product fun to use
i did not order it
i like alexa
cool little speakeri love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great
it is a great product with many good aspects it easy to setup and control with intuitive straight forward instructions the included lightbulb was excellent and worked perfectly i very much enjoy this product and recommend it
it appears to be working fine my first echo stopped replying to my requests and i received the echo plus very happy no problems no hassel exchange
works great looks brand new love my new echo dot i will be getting them for all the main rooms in the house
good speaker for bedroom or office
after purchasing my echo spot to add to our other 4 amazon echoesi am very pleased with the echo spoti use  it with our arlo security cameras and ring video doorbell and works without any problems
echo show is my personal assistant awesome
absolutely love it
was a gift
i got this for dad on father's day  he was tickled with it
i love these i have 2 dots and one echo for a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although i do use external for the dots
very easy setup and alexa can be heard well and receive very well
product turns on randomly and sometimes at night
alarm and music information the weather
arrived as expected
great speaker great microphone response  loving my purchase and the beginning of my smart home
 
love it still learning makes a lot of things easier like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask alexa to turn the light off
i am just entering the smart technology world i have not figured it all out yet but so far it is pretty cool
just got my third one love them
very cool and lots of fun used for a week and still learning its capabilities
i loved everything about this item quick response time and very sensitive to me speaking from the other end of the house
we were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features how nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command looking forward to exploring other options with this device
i jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an echo  i feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later the device is sharing news and weather  now we use it some but have not tapped in to all options  still testing it out
worked just as good as the two new echo dots i preciously purchases
it is a fun item to have  has a lot of udefulness  big negative is that it does not use google or any real search engine to get answers or find information
looks great
excelente su funcionamiento y llama la atención la rapidez de respuesta y el control que se logra a través de la utilización con alexa me sorprendió gratamente muy recomendable
i owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since english is her second language she was born in korea but the sound from the echo is superb so we will keep it
so far the certified refurbished echo dot works well it was a little confusing to have a green ring on the echo dot and not 100% know why it was there asked alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in but that was not the case took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that i had a delivery from amazon i believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification but on my refurbished echo dot it was green and pulsed
just like new no problems whatsoever alexa thank you
nice upgrade from an echo dot
 
started taking on her own have not used it since i unplugged it that day no one was talking my daughter was laying in bed next to be and she just started going on about the movie moana and completely scared the sht out of my daughter now
it is amazing i love it
the only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality  a massive difference from the alexa  which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase thiswon’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve
the ease of set up and overall functionality makes this echo show worth every penny  i especially like setting my background screen and being able to set affirmations that i use as personalized reminders
very pleased with my purchase of echo smart speaker   love the fact that i can play music of different genre's whenever i wanthad some trouble at first with the wi fi but it is now working
the alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work i was not aware of that  disappointed
 
i use the echo dot several different ways in my home i use it downstairs to control lighting i also take it out on my deck to stream music to a bluetooth speaker it works great for what i need
works great upgraded from echo dot to full size echo could not be happier
very satisfied with the echo alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to jimmy buffet by just asking alexa
works great
i will be returning it  it is been nothing but annoying  the hub can not be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my hue bridge  i can not even install philips lights with it unless i unplug it to do so  there are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues  bottom line is it sucks as a hub  it does not support z wave and zigbee which in fairness i knew in advance but when the one protocol it does support does not do many functions that a dedicated one will what is the point  i noticed right away that my philips hue bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this does not  i found that rather interesting
i love this clock i just have to tell it to set my alarm  no more fussing with buttons
amazon music is great love the ability to create my only playlists has great sound not up to the standard of our bose but very good
i am thoroughly enjoying my ecoo  love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then i can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more
excellent product set up with ease as well
amazing
i love these i have 2 dots and one echo for a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although i do use external for the dots
i bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and i was excited when it came in the next day i set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine the set up was easy and straight forward which i really appreciated because i am terrible with technology the only reason why i am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that i can not use the echo dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet i am connected to both 24ghz and 5ghz wifi links and neither works it is very frustrating because i am not getting my use out of the echo dot and i really wish i could if any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know
my kids love alexa skills are amazing would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions
i own the first and second generation echo dot  i think i prefer the volume ring of the first gen better than the buttons on the second gen but still more than does the job and great for the price i got it for  i would still definitely recommend
not working
my husband and i are what i would call late adopters when it come to technology but we decide we would try and echo to serve primarily as a music source  wow were we amazed and the great sound  we have also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking alexa  i may even buy one for my elderly dad   i think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us
i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo i would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker oh well it is what it is and i still love it i am just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but does not take up a whole lot of space
it is like siri in fact siri answers more accurately then alexa  i do not see a real need for it in my household though it was a good bargain on prime day deals
very easy to set up and have no issues
alexa rocks
i like it all
this product has made my life much simpler with a little one i use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on off or up down is a breeze the screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news
with the combination of this smart plugins and the alex app i can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling alexa to do it i can order stuff get answers watch videos get weather set alarms video call and so much more with this device
music
no enough video options
firestick easy to use and i enjoyed it
handy as hell 10 10 recommend
i reached out to amazon because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use  customer service could not help they basically told me to contact sprint to assist  so echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up so its kind of pointless to have and pay for
love it
great sound quality great features great product multi room music is very cool
seems to have trouble hearing me when i say the wake word despite being trained to my voice wonder if this has something to do with buying it refurbished our google home mini has no problems hearing us 😬 and is much louder
kids like it for games  showing the lyrics for songs is neat
we like it better than roku  voice commands really work
the alexa program is great but the quality is not the best it could definitely be louder
i liked it until on day after a year it no longer worked would not power up  and go past the firestick  logo on tv bought a second one will not buy a third if this one does not last longer
 
it is fun to use and makes my life easier in some sense
bought a refurb and its works just as my new ones i bought prior came in original packaging as well
excelente lo unico es que no esta en español
during prime day this 2nd gen echo was on sale so i could not resist this was the beginning to my smart home set up and i could not be happier to say that alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my smart devices thanks to her i can control my lights smart plugs tv etc i had no trouble connecting the echo to my wifi and my phone the app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills routines smart devices timers and so much more sound quality is good enough for me since i am not an audiophile alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume design is great and modern it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale overall this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities if you have not yet be sure to add alexa to your home
works great i bought this direct from amazon and i have got to tell you this item echo show and echo plus is the best item i have ever had and i am kind of a tech geek i am a disabled person and it helps me turn light on and off and schedule doctor appointments using google voice phone and get my medical rides to and from hospitals plays music on cue from multiple web apps and watch videos as well as communicating to my nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events i wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights they are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off thank god no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights thank you amazon i will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from affirmcom to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house jeff bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability i was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on ssdi thank you all again
love warehouse buys if this was just in good used condition then new must be newer than new seriously this one was perfect not a mark on it anywhere great buy
i love the sound quality of this unit it is a very clear sound
i like how small it is but i am still able to see my ring cameras
love this product i use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options the only thing i would like to see them add on to it is the ability to fall asleep to mu as if and set a timer for it to go off on it is own like you can with tv t hcfe sleep mode
wish volume was capable of going louder
it does not speak in spanishi bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when i am not aroundno spanish
sound quality is great still learning about all the different things i can do with it fun
love it
perfect condition i love my echo
i love this product so far only because of the few things i can do with itsuch as set a timer a reminder play music and games i do not like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things it was also very difficult to set up the directions made it sound as simple as one two three but they forgot about step four five and six i was almost ready to send to backthe app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up however depending on what you are going to be using it for i think it is an ok item
it worked as a charmed
i liked the original echo this is the same but shorter and with greater fabric color choices i miss the volume ring on top now it is just the plus minus buttons not a big deal but the ring w as comforting  other than that well i do like the use of a standard usb charger  port instead of the previous round pin other than that i guess it sounds the same seems to work the same still answers to alexa echo computer so what is not to like 
i bought this for a family member as a gift i called her to see how she likes it & she said she loves it‼️
i bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better  i will ship this to my daughter though because i like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now
set up is so easy
 
 
sure did  love it 
awesome easy set up linked right up with my nexia home automation
still have not learn all the echo can do but so far quite pleased
amazing
if you belong to amazon prime i would think that you could watch any video on it that was in the library  you can with prime music
amazing it has helped me become better organized gives me traffic updates weather updates and helps me maintain a good fast morning routine
purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do  so far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform  am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides
works great but i do not think amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1 have prime and 2 buy an echo
tremendous way to communicate with friends and family all across the country
i love it i want to get another one very  very  soon
met and exceeded my expectations easy set up and is really quick in responses
i absolutely love this thing and i love amazon because my echo show went bonkers and all it took was a brief chat and voila a new one to replace it is on the way i was floored when the screen started blurring and shaking and jumping and missing part of its data alexa still talked but i could not watch movies so happy that amazon is so easy to deal with and makes good on its products without any hassle at all
works great and simple to set up alexa is way more accurate than i imagined so im using it more than i thought wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaintno she's not listening when you do not say the wake word so if you're worried you can lose the conspiracy theories the speaker is great too so do not hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me
love our little dot i do not know what the original larger alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities
we put one in the bedroom  it plays music and tells us the weather  it also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning  it is better than a clock radio  it will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites  it can even tell jokes  i do not know how i got along without it before now  amazing
great to wake up to music and being told the weather
adding more rooms for convenience
great definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 i can not really regret it at all love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to the smiths
omg we love it
i purchased the amazon echo plus on amazon prime day because i need a hub i am in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home for the same price as some hub's and even less expensive in some other cases i got a hub that works with my devices plus it does a lot more i have not even had time to go through all the skills it has but i have already found myself using many of them when i started a search for a hub i was not even considering the echo in part because i did not know it was a hub but also because i did not really think i would find much use for another ai system if you're looking for a hub why settle for a plane hub when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost's the same or less than other hubs oh and by the way for the same price as the amazon echo plus alone i found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug given the price of these extras well that just put the echo plus over the top
i am loving my easy access to all the music and books i listen to from amazon music and audible  the treble mid and bass sound well equalized  i love that i can easily take it to any area of my house and plug it in  it is nice and light weight with a good length of cord
very cool product speaker sounds good with my spotify blasting through it
 
i love it in my living room
it is so efficient and amazing  how cool  we all use it often every day
 
i like the interaction of asking questions i do not like that i can not ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp
love this
this unit add much pleasure to our echo plus  we now can have music and information through our home or just in one room
it works just as well as the new version i got as a discount with my echo speaker i decided to purchase this version because amazon states it has the same warranty
good as new perfectly packaged and i have had zero issues with the dot
loved it till someone stoled it can not afford to replace it yet but i am going too
very cool and lots of fun used for a week and still learning its capabilities
love it do not know what took me so long to get one — and do not know why i did not get two on amazon prime day
really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house
overall it is great and i like that i can see lyrics and the time and  date however sometimes it freezes and does not respond properly  no error message about lack of connectivity  it just stops resetting resolves the problem
i love how compact it is
love it i got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes we love it
love it can not stop using it
love my echo spot
kids love it i love it
love this wished i had gotten it sooner
gave it my daughter for her birthday she loves it sound is amazing she plays music on it constantly worth every penny this is the third amazon device purchased we have 2 echo shows and now the spot
really happy with this purchase  great speaker and easy to set up
we have six of these throughout our home and they are great  there are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening  there should be more options to change the name of the engagement command alexa or computer are a little annoying  more colors then black and white would also be a good thing
it works good  very satisfied
works perfectly
it won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tvit connects but won’t work
kids love it i love it
only problem is my slow internet i really like the speaker on it having tons of fun with it
terrific
i did not realize it needed an external power source in order to utilize the fire stick i thought it was more along the lines of a flash drive device you singley plugged into your tv however since using my amazon fire stick i have enjoyed every moment of it and would definitely recommend this product to any and all
awesome thing love alexa
sure did  love it 
did not really work as smooth as they make it seem like
so far we have enjoyed it  the only problem we have is i have not been able to call one of my sons with it the sad part is he is the one who gave it to me 
absolutely love it
easy to set up and connect with smart devices just what i needed
it is better than i thought it practically turns your regular tv into a smart tv
works great
let’s start withdislikes now i want to buy 7 more to have them all over my housedo i even need to add my likes now hahaawesome fun and useful nothing else to say
only complaint i have is that the sound quality isn't great i mostly use it for commands though and i have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through i have a couple friends that have a dot and do not mind the audio quality but if you're bothered by that kind of thing i would go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers
very useful
works great just like the new one that i already had
easy to setup love all the things she does
this product is easy to use and very entertaining  i have yet to hook it up to my tv or lights but look forward to doing so
works as expected this is our fourth one our son loves it in his room easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it
like new good refurbishing
cool little speakeri love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great
a great replacement for the bedside alarm clock which had a funny habit of going off at 12am every time the cleaning ladies came through we mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off while leaving the fan running only gripe would be the mic sensitivity which does not appear be as good as the view or gen2 it can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself
is great use it for music mostly
works great has great picture easy to setup and use
luv it  it is a great product
this has been perfect for being able to see my canary cameras and that’s exactly what i wanted i have been happy with all my alexa’s because we have several and this is a great addition
it works just like my other dots
product forces user to review alexa things to try there is no way to disable it
i love my echo dot  the price i paid during prime day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles but this does so much more  i can play music set alarms call friends play games set timersthe list goes on and on  definitely worth the money
love it
works great killer speaker my wife and son love it
great addition to our alexa family great video also
i already have an alexa and with amazon find today i could not resist getting an echo also it is the best thing i ever did i use them on each side of the house and could not be happier
works well just disappointed with the speaker quality but hooked it up to old computer speakers
got this as a gift and love it i never would have bought one for myself but now that i have it allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music  that's worth it in and of itself  also gives new's briefs and tells jokes
well behaved device that i enjoy using
awesome loving alexa
doubtful at first but it works a lot better than my smart devicesplus alexa software include that was a plus
love it
overall i like this though siri on my phone can do more for what i need as i do not have a smart home and do not intend to make it one but it is fun and i use it for music and to have it read me my audible books
un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como el tiempohorainformación de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet
easy to set up
it worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound it is perfect for my classroom
i do love it was easy to set up so far but i wish it has a little more in the set up instructions there is still a whole lot more i would like to be able to do with it and i have no idea if i can or not with it but i really do like it
i love the idea is the star trek computer at home the skills are great but the natural language work is mediocre
the echo show works great i enjoy  very much
blue light blinks all the time
worked perfect
i like it
we love it finally got one for everyone in the home most importantly we are saving money that would have otherwise gone to cable
it is very easy to usei can now watch my favorite movies
great product and works great
love my spot she even more than i expected great size for a bedroom
i like to watch older shows 70's and 80's and the firestick gives me the opportunity to find those shows
great product
so far so good  much better sound than my echo dot
personal
third echo dot purchased love the product
love it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo it is awesome have used it for everything my lights since i work nights and shopping as well as for my spotify and planning on getting it for my parents to help them out for everyday things we take for granted when we are young i would recommend this to everyone
easy to use
very easy to set up does what is said it will very satisfied so far
i love alexa she works great but she not for little children she does not understand if you do not speak clearly she fun to have
love it great product
i love my new echo dot right now i mainly use it to play music at night but it gets the job done
love it
access to apps
just like it is big sister the echo only smaller with slightly less audio fidelity but much lower price on amazon prime day used in another room to add alexa to an additional room
to have ability to play amazon music outside for patio gatherings i also used blue tooth to connect echo plus via alexa app on my tablet to an external speaker when if the party extends into the yard i have plans to connect other devices such as thermostat and other lighting and home devices
arrived as expected
i am pleased with the echo show from the sound of the music and the words to the tunes to the news and weather the color on the screen for my photos could be better
i absolutely love this  i have it in my kitchen so i can use it for cooking the speakers are amazing
works great
totally enjoy our new echo plus  great for fast facts and listening to beautiful music  we are just getting started with all the benefits
best purchase this year
great
love it
love the fire stick alexa works well on it too would recommend
makes turning on and off things in the house so simple great for little updates as well like checking the weather and such
love it
i can not get multiple profiles working it just spins when adding a 2nd user at pass device prompt
it arrived quickly and was easy to set up  it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what i expected  alexa and i have become buddies she is a great assistant
definitely a really good buy for first time buyers of smart home stuff =]i bought 3 =]
great product
i have had alexa since the beginning  i accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation  i decided i could not be without an echo  setup was easy and had it working within minutes
love the echo show can keep i can video chat with the kids and grandkids i have it in the kitchen so when i run out of something i have alexa to add it to my grocery list i use it for everything was very easy to set up
we are a long time amazon prime family many years but new to the alexa world and thought the purchase of alexa plus with hub and included phillips hue light bulb would be a great start alexa does a lot of good things for us like alarm in the morning verbalize books playing music on command even linked to my sirrius xm account good daily stuff good sound but not bose but the ads say hub included so do not need anything else to operate devices well not so i understand there will be some differences in product device  support the fact that it came with the hue light bulb works only for on  off  dimming of the bulb the bulb is capable of so much more with the hue app but the hue app does not recognize alexa hub as a bridge so it appears you do have to get a philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes time the lights when you are away set color tones etc that can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home the list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge was very disappointed to find that out after the fact to the point i feel we are being misled by amazon by included the hue bulbs without explanation maybe throw a good discount my way to get the hue bridge if i keep the echo plus before i invest in more light bulbs
thank god and alarm clock with an lcd that gets dim enough for me to sleep i am a very light sensitive sleeper and wind up taping black tape over all my other stuff in my bed room not this guy the alexa features are nice and listening to music at night is great we enjoy falling asleep to meditation podcasts though we have to use the skill anypod to get the podcasts we like video is kinda tiny and useless at this size but that's to be expected audio quality is much better than echo dot
i set her up to play through our home theater system so fat we are just using her for weather forecasts cooking timers and we really enjoy the music
my 3rd echo device very easy to set up works perfectly
great
perfect
love the echo plus much better versatility than the first generation echo intercom and voice controllable smart bulbs are awesome
works better than anticipated this thing is awesome
easy set up very user friendly
when we first received this product it was great  however about a week ago the device served up a video advertisement around 1030pm at night and scared myself and my family  if you want to make sure you are protected and do not allow video directly in your home the spot is not a device that can keep you safe
no issuesworks and looks great
love this so many options
nice little unit  no issues
great device my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me
love my new addition to the house speaker quality is great and over all we love our alexa my only two  not complaints more suggestions for the future series would be better communication ability example for our smart lights in the house unless we specify kitchen light 1 or kitchen light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she does not recognize it may be me but i want my alexa to respond when i say thank you afterwards i have to repeat alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me but will my husband i know it sounds odd we laugh about it but maybe it is a southern thing but i want my alexa to have manners too
ease of use
i love alexa  i am surprised how much i use her
works and sounds great
love it beautiful experience especially if hooked to smart lighting and other accessories
wonderful product and fast delivery
love this  have it in the kitchen and works well
i have had for only a week so i am still learning all that alexa can do  it is a learning process  i love the music i can call up any time  i listen to podcasts and radio stations  i have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists which i love  i do not have to search for paper and pencil  getting time and temperature are great do not have to wait for weather reports  the sound is good  i am not fussy about woofers tweeters base  etc  the echo is fine for me  this afternoon i am going to try dropping inon my son when he gets home  going to surprise him
very impressed  simple to use
i have only had this a week but so far so good  we are enjoying it
love all of it
this was an impulse buy and i am super happy i made the purchase i love this so much i immediately bought my parents one now we can video chat easily i love all the features and how easy this is to use and set up
i love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices
nothing to dislike and it does a lot more than i expected
great to play music throughout the house great and easily fits in my decor of my home
love this replaced an old alarm clock in my bedroom with this  love that it dims at night very responsive to commands
love it
super easy setup only issue i find is that it occasionally loses connection with household network
have had this around a week i love that i can control items in my house even if i am not there makes me feel better about being away from the house and people do not know that we are gone alexa has not disappointed
versatile and fun 
love it
great  it was the best decision  especially if you have amazon prime
love my echo dot
loved it
i like the way you can watch anything and everything  for some live shows you need a cable provider
like new
the packaging was beautiful and then there she was we have 2 dots and an echo plus already now we have the show and we love it an echo for each roomyou can also say alexa turn off the screen and it will go black this is good for sleeping
item returned for repair receivded item back from repair 07 23 18  parts missing no power cord includedplease advise
i love that i can shut the microphone off at night so my children can not talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music not sure how i survived with out this for so long
small size works great in our sunroom
i like how clear the screen is hi resolution
comes with a hub  got it during prime day for $99 and a hue white bulb  works great  now i can add more stuff that required a hub
i am huge amazon fan first to have a kindle and the echo i waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile i do love it my kids love it they love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out i thought as long as someone would facetime me i could do it through that and i can not it is spot to spot can not even skype which i do often with my aunt the is my major disappointment with it
love the dot
i love alexa and when i had the chance to add show to my home i jumped at it  but i am a member and my show does not know i paid for the extras with my echo now in the upstairs bedroom  if i am supposed to pay more for having show added to my home then i am afraid to ask what is the point
very nice and its does not take up space
have had no issues with this refurbished unit it performed expected i would buy another one if needed
i had a brand new echo dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good it was quite different from my expectations refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while i realized that the power adapter was faulty there is no way for me to have amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options i love amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let downupdate amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter this is why i shop on amazon i can always trust them to deliver on their products
surprisingly handy wish it had more options geared towards it being on your nigh stand like an even dimmer setting
very pleased with my purchase of echo smart speaker   love the fact that i can play music of different genre's whenever i wanthad some trouble at first with the wi fi but it is now working
es perfecto
i can connect my smart lights and my phone and any other smart device it is just so convenient that i highly reccomend it to anyone who have the disposable income
great in the kitchen  i love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes  also great for listening to music and watching shows on amazon prime video while i cook  i subsequently bought an echo dot with the ihome clock docking station for the bedroom  i created a group so i can play music on both of them at the same time  i plan to add more speakers in the future
just what i expected
this thing is great fantastic alarm clock
it is a great product and easily set up just have to get it in sync with your personal set up
got a good deal and works great with prime  setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service  has worked great with nice sound from small speaker
we are still testing this one out and so far we like it i was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first unfortunately it sometimes gets our wifi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we have been able to manage and fix it i mean it is convenient especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the dot i do like that it plays music and has reminders alarms etc   i am just still getting used to the fact that the man is always listening now
easy set up
can not be used as a baby monitor which is why i had purchased it  i did not realize this until i read the reviews on the alexa skill for syncing the nest cam  considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix surprised amazon has not upgraded the software to allow more than 39 minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the nest app
i love love love love it  i feel like i have a talking computer that tells me everything
alexa is fun i have added smart home aspects my friend listens to spotify my husband enjoys interacting too
really enjoying my firestick can not wait to get rid of  cable such a waste of money
what we liked most was actually seeing the words to song least would be i guess i expected a little more from her than is currently available
pros  plenty loud for a large room with high ceilingscons   the hub does not do anything  it does not work with z wave as it states it does not take voice commands for smartthings which i had to buy since the hub does not work for z waveit also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the eq not sure if that is on all models but the dots we have are clearfor the money buy an echo dot or echo 2nd generation  the echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub go figure and the audio is clear the dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper
i agree youtube should be on there
i am very pleased with the echo show i love that it has so many nice features i highly recommend it
 
i was hoping the cord was white also otherwise it is fine
as expected
love it
do not use it for much as i thought we would synced with kasa cam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot lyrics for music is cool too other than that it is used as a clock and standard dot’ish features
great fun getting to know all the functions of this product  wow    family fun and homework help  talking with other grandchildrenwho also have an echo is a huge bonus  can not wait to learn more and more and more
i am still learning how to use it  i figured out it can read my kindle books to me which is a real bonus
i took advantage of prime friday and decided to take a chance and purchase one  i enjoy the features it comes with i am sorry i did not purchase two of them  well worth the money  its looks great on my nightstand  every night it puts me to steep with sleeping music  happy customer
convenient and fun
works great and easy to set up
i am finding more and more uses for this all the time it keeps me informed with news and weather i can get a daily bible verse and have it play music new skills are added all the time the future is here
i love it  used one like this in philly while visiting my son and decided to buy my own on prime day 
it is an echo with a screen hence still needs work has me considering google home now
awesome i love that it shows the lyrics of songs
awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life great purchase
honestly i like it but at the same time i do not i could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half i bought it for the video chat and i have never really used it
works like a new one  can tell the difference from the new one i bough and the refurbished one
no youtube
i do love these things i have them running my entire home tv all my lights my thermostat my front door dead bolt the cameras and i love listening to npr these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek i named mine computer to get the feel but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems
great addition to my alexa base using it in my guest bedroom for music clock and infodot speaker is not as strong as the base but it is a great value
we have 3 echos now even one in the barn great idea for when i am working with my horse can still get news flashes & my music
love my new echo plus
love this
we like it all so far but have a lot to try out yet
once set up very user friendly set up was not as user friendly as i would hoped the alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers my wife and i are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install alexa but if my son was not supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using alexa yet
i received my echo dot today in good condition but be advised i paid $2999 for it and amazon has as of this writing raised the price to $3999 so do your research before buying so you can get a good dealset up with the dot went simple enough — plug it in follow the app instructions except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iphone’s wifi settings i called amazon customer service and i dunno what it is but lately i have been getting terrible support the guy that took my call just rambled off a completely unhelpful script and i ended up setting up the dot while he was in the middle of his spieli am not sure if this is the norm or if it is because this is refurbished but the dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5ghz connection is strong reconnecting is a pain each time as wellall that said when alexa works she works amazingly well i do not have a speaker hooked up to it but one thing i really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity one of the more annoying limitations of apple’s siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers music podcasts etc the hey siri feature is all but useless alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time and with amazingly fast responsiveness too i have not tried this with louder speakers yet so i am not sure if this will continue to hold truesetting up alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze albeit with limitations — support for arlo devices is nil and if you have special settings for your led devices eg rainbow effects alexa can not handle them she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levelsall in all my rating would’ve been lower had i not gotten a decent price on this item if the connectivity problems persist i may have to exchange return this item i do not want to though — alexa’s kind of growing on me
 
yet another exho for our home and love them all
works great nice sound and picture
great love it
although this is my second echo device i am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation instructions as to the many functions of the device  i purchased becausse of the sound quality but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident  there needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device  or at least point out where it can be found
i am still learning how to use the echo but so far i love it
we are still discovering all that the echo can do
awesome i love alexa
i reached out to amazon because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use  customer service could not help they basically told me to contact sprint to assist  so echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up so its kind of pointless to have and pay for
sound quality
perfect works great no problems with it being refurbished
love it makes the simple things in life simpler
listens well does way more than expected love her
love it
i love this item and being able to hear any kind of music  i enjoyed it so much that i ordered another
this product is even better than i imagined i love the timer setting it reminds me to put the clothes in the dryer if i ask it to and i love shopping list feature  my family enjoys the games too it is made my life a little more easy alexa is my personal assistant 
easy installation and set up better sound from the echo dot smart speaker very satisified with purchase
love my echo
am very happy now that i can see
love my alexa actually have 3 throughout the house favorite function is lists great for time management and if course music
i am still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub so bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and i was looking forward to this feature being able to play music check the weather etc is fine
easy to set up and start using works as advertised
so awesome to bring my older tv to life
the outlet does not work with it was disappointed in that
plug n play set up is simple added battery base to make it portable looking forward to using the hub
family loved it
thumbs up
i love to watch my wife argue with alexa  i woke up one night listening to alexa talking to my cell phone 
works fine
great product more skills are needed i love it
a great device
love it love it love it
i really like this item i already had the echo dot but with this purchase the philips hue bulb came with the plus just purchasing the plus i have not had time to use it to its full capabilities but the bulb is something else i use that with the echo dot to turn on our bedroom light and i really like it the plus is in our great room kitchen area so far i give this a 5 star
lovee it it has evrything i need it now i cant even get my dad out of my room hahahaha movie addicts
alexa did not know answers to many questions we asked for example we asked how many cups in a pound and she said a pound is a form of money
i love it
super easy to set up  easy to use lots of app options available
i wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live  the speech recognition software is horrible  my wife and i both are native americans whose language is english she is from the north i am from texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us  we bought two they do the same thing  additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal i had to buy wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router  both had problems switched them around no difference  so it they are now disconnected dust collectors
still trying to figure out how to link to bluetooth speaker
great for my office i use this daily in many ways to include spelling for me and background music
have had for just one week so far and i can say it is a blast to have
i love the echo show i am going off to live on campus for school in the fall and we got two of these to serve as an easy way to connect some people might not like the camera but that makes little sense we carry devices with cameras all the time the only difference here is that the item is stationary my family and i also find the drop in feature a comfort rather than an invasion of privacy it is definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versai would also like to thank amazon for including their voiceview screen reader on the device the show would be a lot less blind friendly even with alexa present if they had not included thatwe are an echo loving household with two dots three echos and now two shows i wouldn’t be surprised if we got more in the future for ourselves or loved ones thanks amazon
we love our echo spots we now have three through the house and like that you can drop in on the other spots we do wish the clock faces had more customization options and that there were more faces in general
love it  great to request music and be able to see lyrics  i had a dot but this is so much better
so far so good  not to tech savvy so i am still trying to figure out what i can do with it but it was easy to set up and so far easy to use  lots of apps that it can use  i will have to play with it some more but its fun to have
the echo plus works as expected but i never received the philips hue smart bulb that was supposed to be included as part of my purchase please advise
i got my echo spot on prime day and love it i think it still is a little expensive but the chance to save $30 convinced me to buy it i basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly i also like the sleep sounds skill and hearing the weather i am still exploring the other skillsjust discovered some star trek sounds alexa beam me up which are fun
well made productecho spot   white
very handy in the kitchen sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps
i use it primarily to play music  it works wonderfully  still getting used to some of the many things it will do  amazon has sent several tips since i got it thanks for all your help
easy setup very fun to use connects with all my smart home appliances
great
the refurbished echo for has been wonderful i purchased this for my mother she loves the ability to contact me without a phone listen to music weather and ask questions it is been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems
love love love my new and free assistant  
everything
does everything as expected and more
it works great better than the previous fire stick
love it   am using it strictly for music now and it is great
put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm works great every morning i get the weather and news when i get up also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and i have
 
i like the volume up and down on the top so i can turn it down quickly
excellent device  works great having no problems or concerns
this is my 2nd fire tv stick with alexa i have been very happy with my first one love that you can use so many apps with it big 👍
this is my second echo i have the dot but the speaker is weak so i purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great
 
this is great got one for my gazebo and one upstairs
i have had the first gen echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me i purchased the 2nd gen during prime day and so far i am happy it seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such
super good
just getting use to using the echo used it for shopping lists listening to music and as a timer working great so far
 
i owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since english is her second language she was born in korea but the sound from the echo is superb so we will keep it
we regret waiting so long to purchase this item we are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality
this thing is awesome for grocery lists paired with the anylist app the flash briefing is very good too my only complaint is that once you pause something alexa decides that you no longer want to listen to that thing forever all in all definitely worth the purchase
outstanding product   easy to use  works great
love it
i think this is the 5th one i have purchased i am working on getting one in every room of my house i really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all echos and controlling the lights throughout my house
i love this product  i am not very computer literate but everything is voice controlled  i use this to keep in touch with my daughter she lives out of town  now we just drop in on each other it is like we are living net door to each other
i love this device it is so great what a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker only reason i did not give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing youtube videos and google play music the camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it is dark in the roomother than those minor things i love it great buy and would buy again
ask it to play motown radio on pandora and it keeps asking if i want to add a salsa station motown isn’t close to salsa phonetically
very easy set up really enjoying it
works great
absolutely love it i use it for everythingi tell my friends and clients that it is the daughter i never had i ask her to do something and she does not complain i wish i bought the 2package deal  i truly needed one in my work room i kick myself for it
awesome
highest rating
this device is awesome
i was a little nervous when i received my new echo as i am not really tech savvy i found it a bit intimidating at first but it did not take me to long to figure it out i am very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot
the ease in installing
my difficulty is i dont have a cell phoneand now you cant download the alexa app on a mac book air  so i am stuck unable to program my echo show properly in my opinion you should be able to tell the echo show what you need done and the echo show does it every time i ask for something i am referred back to the alexa appon your mobile device which i cannot accessto me this is not intelagence but dependence on other equipment to functionevery thing today is pushed to the phone  because the phone has been made accessable  to all those who wish  to gather information
it is great but sound quality is very low
i love this thing it plays my books from audible or prime music and sets my alarms if you’re considering purchasing one get it it is worth it
i love it super easy to use hole the button and speaktakes you right to it without delay
i love my little echo spot i have replaced my older full size echo with this little guy the round screen is an interesting choice and i am not sure i like the look but it is growing on me the speakers could be slightly louder but all in all it is a solid echo product
when you think about it this really does not do much play music answer stupid questions finally it was able to hook up to thermostat i can see why price is dropping like a rock
it talks to me plays the type of music i want to listen to and even turns off when i ask if to
the speaker could be better
perfect
this is our third echo worth every penny it is like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate we keep them in the bedrooms and the living room we can drop in and use them as an intercom listen to music answer quick questions alarms to wake up for school etc
we love everything
setup was easy and usage was intuitive  i have used it away from home and it works great
i was a little apprehensive about buying a refurbished electronic product but with amazon's guarantee thought i would try it glad i did and will probably buy another refurb product form amazon i love the alexa products and have several this one sits on my desk has a small footprint but has great sound and i use it daily works great
this is an awesome product i wanted to test out the differences between this and my roku and both are very nice i will likely be using this for traveling as well
the most fascinating thing i have ever bought
we are using the internet for our home and loving them
i love it i want to get another one very  very  soon
enjoying it so much
i love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one
i really love this item  so much fun
excellent product
i switched to google the amazon helper is more for shopping and google is the tasks assistant
it is as if we are having a conversation with another person  instantaneous response  and the fact that it catches your command even when you're far from it is simply just amazing
bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months hard and soft reset will not fix the problem
this  is my second echo to purchase    the price was so cheap    i am seriously thinking of buying 2 more    i use alexa for everything    it is the next best thing to the internet   
really like it
as always easy to set up
everything
i have the google home that i really like the echo plus i think has even a better sound and am totally happy with it
love it    have one inside house and one by our pool now  just as good as bose speakers around house  
it is easier to do things with it
i will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible with my lifetime amazon spending approaching nearly $40000 i am sure i am just a small customer to them but i have rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of amazon purchasesi have 8+ echos for home automation and bought this echo plus specifically for the built in hub along with approximately $600+ in zigbee light switches the voice control is subpar even when it works and that is a rarity most often it does nothing i could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the amazon zigbee ecosystem if you value your money and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere
for the price the product is nice quality and has a few nice features so definitely no complaints there the reason why i only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what i thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error first i did not know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work so i really do not like that it is not a stand alone device also the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a bluetooth speaker do not lastly i am sure the echo dot can do a lot but i have not quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own plus setting it up was awful i would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually alexa
could not be more pleased amazon hit this one out of the park looks great and runs great love it
i have 2 echos one i bought brand new and the other is a refurbished onehonestly i can not tell the difference in performance and looks
love this my daughter enjoys telling alexa what to do haha
works as you’d expect and then some also good sound quality considering price 7000 on sale and features
the menu''s are cumbersome to get your apps set up
we love alexa we use her to play music play radio through itunes play podcasts through anypod and set reminders we listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning we rely on our custom lists we like being able to voice control the volume we are sure we will continue to find new usessometimes it is a bit frustrating when alexa does not understand what we are saying
i use this echo to listen to music as well as a sort of research tool it can answer a variety of questions i would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder but i can not complaini also believe it should have an internal power source in order to use the echo it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord it would be nice to use the echo dot on the go without having to buy the other product
love the alarm featurejust tell what time
i love that you can watch bob dylan’s movies
have alexa throughout the house    the future has arrived
yes it met my expectations  the snooze on the alarm needs a but of work  tap it and it snoozes swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss  but without my glasses i can not read it and often it just snoozes  then one day i must have dismissed tomorrow's alarm because it never went off  i have it set for mon thu  fri i do not need to get up early  a more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice  my old alarm had a red light
turned our old tv into a smart tv really easy interface have bought 4 now
what can i say well i am a  paranoid it person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control so yes i love my echo stuff but i did create a isolated vlan on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app be carful with these people  entering your wi fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing try to stay with devices that  work directly with the alexa hub with no third party app amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled
i love having this on my desk the fact that i can video with friends listen to music with the words right there and see my amazon cloud cam feeds from one location is pretty spectacular i got this one sale too which was stellar it has me thinking i need another one for the front room
worth every cent
she does not always listen

my daughter has an echo show and she told me how much she loved it i bought a white one for my kitchen and absolutely love it  it has all the features of the others plus great extras the sound system is awesome i also own the original echo tower dots and spot each are great and have their uses around my house i highly recommend all of these products
i love this technology i am older but this is so easy to set up and use i have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything i use my echo for which is in the living room
love my echo spot
